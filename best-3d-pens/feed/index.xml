		<description><![CDATA[Why don&#039;t you update the 3Doodler entry to Create or Start? They are vastly better than they used to be...and their accessory range in 2017 is really nice. Just saw them at NY toy fair and I was impressed.

Btw - I just received my LIX pen...massively disappointed with it. Can only hope they make a V2 soon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mara,
We are receiving a lot of complains from our readers about LIX and we have placed a warning message in our blog post about LIX. We will not advise you to buy LIX right now, you can however browse other high performing 3D pens listed in our comprehensive 3D pen guide. We are hopeful that you will find your best match:)
Cheers!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Before buying a 3D Lix Pen I would read all comments and research. The company states ‚ÄúPlease understand that we are a company which produces electronic hardware, those products tend to fail or malfunction from time to time, as all electronic products do.‚Äù My Lix Pen did not work out of the box. I paid postage back to the company ‚Äúonly to be told I had to pay more because the Lix Pen was being held by customs. When I asked for a full refund I was told they do not give full refund on used/damaged Lix Pen. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt work out of the box.‚Äù So I repeat.

		<description><![CDATA[So the 3d Simo Mini was awesome.....for about a week till the feed mechanism broke.  I literally just got spools of ABS and PLA filament as well. SO i haven&#039;t been able to heavily use my 3d Simo MINI before it broke. After that i found a spot for comments on Kickstarter that had a lot of people still waiting on orders or frustrated because their pens seemed sub par. Such a shame, because it&#039;s incredibly awesome and different from others. 
But I&#039;m sorry, DO NOT.........support 3d Simo Mini until the creators fix problems with the pen and start supporting their backers!!! Such a shame but when you don&#039;t reply to customers or live up to warranty promises, your BUSINESS SHOULD&#039;NT BE ALLOWED TO BE ADVERTISED AND SHOULD&#039;NT BE ON KICKSTARTED ANY LONGER!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Bec,
I am extremely sorry for your terrible experience with LixPen.
Actually, the pen which I received from them for reviewing purpose worked like a charm and it is still working.

I will contact lixpen on your behalf, and see what I can do for you.
Other than that, I will re-review their Pen by ordering a new one.

Cheers]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just letting you know that you are leading consumers astray by recommending the Lix Pen at all. After paying $220 aud to get one for my mum for christsmas it doesn&#039;t work at all &#038; they&#039;re refusing to refund. Upon further research it turns out this has happened to many purchasers of the Lix Pen, &#038; that they are considered frauds by Kickstarter after ripping their backers off. I bought the pen after reading this (&#038; other) review &#038; can&#039;t help but wonder if this review is based on profit rather than fact.]]></description>
