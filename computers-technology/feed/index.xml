<h3>Why the Latest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B015PD3HOC/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Netgear R8500</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0167HG1V6/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ASUS AC5300</a> are not on my list?</h3>
<hr />
<p>Lots of people wondering that why I didn&#8217;t include the <strong>latest AC5300</strong> models from Netgear and Asus in my Top 10 list? Well, the answer is simple.</p>
<div class="su-list su-list-style-">
<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> These latest routers are extremely expensive.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> To be honest they don&#8217;t deliver any better experience compared to the cheaper routers out the in the market.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> Currently, there are no clients which can take advantage of the latest speed standard (AC5300).</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> Mobile Apps are buggy.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in simple words, you are paying for the latest speed standard AC5300 and there are no computer system or client which can handle it. Isn&#8217;t it a waste of money?</p>
<p>For now, these routers are useless.</p>
<p>However, we believe in the middle of 2017 (July), the clients which can utilize this latest tech will be available. So, I hope both of these routers will make it to the top of our <strong>Best Wireless Routers 2017</strong> List.</p>

<h2>1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B016EWKQAQ/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" name="ourtoprouter">Asus RT-AC88U</a> &#8211; Best wifi router to buy in 2017</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B016EWKQAQ/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-307 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Asus-RT-AC88U-Review.jpg" alt="Asus RT-AC88U Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>Most of the computer enthusiasts or users know Asus because of their top of the line gaming hardware. However, for those who don’t know, Asus is also at the helm for creating several high ends, top of the line routers. The offer we are going to talk about today is known as the RT-AC88U, the router is priced under $300 and it happens to be one of the best wireless routers one can buy right now.</p>
<p>The wireless router offers a stylish sleek look, something that people will find familiar, especially if they have used an Asus product in the past. The router is aesthetically pleasing with its complete black construction with red accents along the antennas, it looks straight out of a gaming lineup by Asus.</p>
<div class="redb">However, most of you are not here for the looks and are more interested in the performance, so without wasting any more time, let’s take a look at how the router performs.</div>
<p>The RT-AC88U is an AC3100 router which comes with a total of 8 Gigabit LAN ports, do keep in mind that these ports are capable of delivering high-speed internet without suffering from any performance issues, and not to forget that it is a dual-band router that can act as a NAS as well. With that said, Asus as paid a significant amount of attention to detail even when designing the web interface as it happens to be super intuitive and easy to use. The WiFi performance of the router on both 2.4 gigahertz and the 5 gigahertz bands stayed faster than ever without any performance decreases.</p>
<h3>Installation, Configuration, and Performance</h3>
<p>The installation process of RT-AC88U is a piece of cake, thanks to the amazing web interface. When you connect it to the PC and internet for the first time and power on the PC, the Asus Web Interface will automatically launch and give you two options to configure the router. Either you can continue with the wizard or you can configure it manually.</p>
<p>The Quick Internet Setup wizard, will check your internet connection and configure your router as a Dynamic IP, Static IP or PPPoE, depends on your connection type selection. After that, it allows you to set a name for each SSID, and then create a network encryption key for each band. After that, it&#8217;s all done.</p>
<p>When it comes to performance, the Asus RT-AC88U provides multi-client MU-MIMO data streaming, works extremely fast on both bands (2.4 Gigahertz and 5 Gigahertz) and File reading/writing and transfers were great.</p>
<div id="visualizer-1099-1605236795" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-1099"></div>
<div class="blueb">In short, the router is perfect if you are willing to spend money on it, it can be coined as “you get what you pay for”.</div>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F0DD0I6/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-314 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-R7000-Review.jpg" alt="NETGEAR Nighthawk R7000 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next up is another dual-band router, but this time, the offering is being done by none other than <a href="http://www.netgear.com/home/products/networking/wifi-routers/">the famous Netgear</a>. For those who don’t know, the company is famous for creating a plethora of top of the line wireless routers that have become increasingly famous overtime. Netgear is a company that has dedicated itself towards providing top of the line, unparalleled networking hardware including their brilliant wireless routers.</p>
<p>The product that we are bringing you today is called the Netgear Nighthawk R7000, and as the name suggests, the router looks nothing less of a stealth fighter jet. The Nighthawk R7000 is AC1900 with 1,300 Mbps speed in the 5 gigahertz band and a 600 Mbps speed on the 2.4 gigahertz band.</p>
<p><strong>I like R7000 more than R8000 because it is affordable and much more easy to install.<br />
During our testing, it was revealed that the R7000 just might be the best Netgear wireless router we have used till date. Curious yet? Let’s find out.</strong></p>
<div class="su-tabs su-tabs-style-default my-custom-tabs" data-active="1"><div class="su-tabs-nav"><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Design</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Performance</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Features</span></div><div class="su-tabs-panes"><div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">From the looks of it, the router looks amazing, it has the minimal, stealthy vibe to it, the router has an all-black construction and comes with 3 detachable antennas. Our only issue on the design front was the weight and the size of the Nighthawk; in all seriousness, the router is an absolute mammoth and needs quite some free space to be put with ease, not to mention the extra bulk it comes with.</p>
<p>However, we found that issue to be subjective as it happens that you will only need to make space for the router once, and won’t be moving it a lot afterward.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">The Netgear Nighthawk offers a stellar performance, as a matter of fact, it is one of the fastest routers we have used till date. The performance on both 5 gigahertz and the 2.4 gigahertz bands is impeccable and didn’t face any hiccups or slowdowns during the entire testing process.</p>
<p>The WiFi router also manages to perform really well on different ranges, and the bands manage to give you performance that is better than the performance was given by your usual Ethernet connection.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">Moving on to the features, the Nighthawk AC1900 is packed with them, if you are wondering what you’ll be getting, you should know that this router comes with the support for DD-WRT, this means that the router is fully capable of running 3<sup>rd</sup> party firmware based on Linux.</p>
<p>The router also comes with the support for OpenVPN and thanks to the OpenDNS, there is a complete parental control package built into the router.</p>
<p>The router even comes with QoS (Quality of Service) for those who don’t know, this is a feature can let you manage the upstream and downstream of your internet connection. Pretty cool, we’d say. If you want more, the router can also act as a NAS and a pretty good one, actually.</div></div></div>
<div id="visualizer-1098-1087168575" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-1098"></div>
<div class="blueb">Overall, the Netgear Nighthawk AC1900 is an impressive router that offers a lot for the price you are paying for it. Sure, it’s bulky and has some performance issues on the 2.4 gigahertz band. But considering the price to performance ratio, the Nighthawk AC1900 is perhaps one of the best routers you can buy in the market right now.</div>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PVD81MK/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-326 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/D-Link-DIR-890l-Review.jpg" alt="D-Link DIR-890l Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next up on our list is one of the top tier wireless routers from D-Link, for those who don’t know, the company has a long history of providing some of the best networking products and the <strong>AC3200 Ultra Wi-Fi DIR-890</strong> isn’t here to tell a different story. As a matter of fact, it is perhaps one of the most stylish looking wireless routers we have encountered. Where the Nighthawk resembled a stealth jet, the DIR-890 looks like it was built by race car enthusiasts. But looks aren’t everything, right? Let’s find out how this router fairs in things that actually matter.</p>
<p><strong>The DIR-890 is an amazing router in terms of speed and functionality.</strong></p>
<p>Testing revealed that the router is fast, easy to setup and use, and has a good speed/range when using for the purpose of Wi-Fi. Another great thing about this router is that it comes with the ability to be doubled up as a NAS by adding an external hard drive.</p>
<div class="redb">Do keep in mind that the DIR-890 is a tri-band router, and if you happen to be a general consumer who just wants a router for normal use, then this one will be an overkill for you.</div>
<div class="su-tabs su-tabs-style-default my-custom-tabs" data-active="1"><div class="su-tabs-nav"><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Design</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Range</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">LAN Ports</span></div><div class="su-tabs-panes"><div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">We have already discussed how the design of this router ends up making a statement of its own, and that’s quite right. The router has an overall red build with black accents. The router easily manages to stand out and if you have a computer that follows the red/black color scheme, this is something you must have. Enough about the looks, let’s talk about the things matter.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">If you happen to live at a comparatively large place and have a lot of Wi-Fi devices that consistently need to be connected to the internet, this one is a must&#8217;ve for you. Although it does come with six antennas and promises proper range, if you happen to have issues with antennas, you’d be sad to know that they can’t be detached.</p>
<p><strong>During the testing, the range seemed promising enough.</strong></div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">If you want more LAN ports, the DIR-890 is not something you want, the router only comes with 4 LAN ports as opposed to some routers that have 8 LAN ports. With that said, if you can overlook that limitation, then the DIR-890L is a stellar router.</div></div></div>
<div id="visualizer-1100-1022659672" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-1100"></div>
<div class="blueb">Whether you love the unique and sharp design of the router, or a number of features it comes with; the DIR-890 by D-Link is perhaps one of the best routers on the market that prefer style over substance but manages to give you a respectable performance.</div>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KWHMR6G/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-320 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Netgear-Nighthawk-R800-Review.jpg" alt="Netgear Nighthawk R8000 X6 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>If you liked the Netgear Nighthawk R7000 but thought that you want something better (But Expensive), then the Nighthawk AC3200 is just what you are looking for.</p>
<p>Though do keep in mind that R8000 is a compliant, tri-band router, it is quite expensive, but don’t worry, the router comes with enough features that will make you ignore the price point and get it anyway.</p>
<p>The Nighthawk AC3200, although has a similar color scheme of its younger sibling, it features a redesign, it is comparatively larger in footprint, however, it happens to be much more compact when compared to the older version; the compactness is because of six antennas that can be collapsed with great ease. With that said, the router still looks epic as far as the aesthetics go.</p>
<div class="redb">Speaking of performance, the Nighthawk AC3200 manages to give the same stellar performance as its younger sibling did. A lot of people might think that it’s a waste of money in that case, but like the saying goes,<strong> “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”</strong>, with that said, seems like Netgear did the exact same thing.</div>
<p>Although it is a wireless router, it can be doubled up as a NAS if you attach an external hard drive with it. Luckily, unlike many other routers, the NAS performance on this one is actually quite good for the price you are paying for it. The router manages to give incredible speeds over the 5 gigahertz band; speeds on the lesser 2.4 gigahertz band is good enough, but not something to write home about</p>
<div id="visualizer-1097-1234336369" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-1097"></div>
<div class="blueb">The Netgear R8000 Nighthawk X6 AC3200 is an impressive wireless router whose shortcomings make it a bit of a hard decision to purchase. If you are looking for something that gives you amazing performance over the 5 gigahertz band and has a stellar performance as a NAS, then this router should be your pick. It is not wrong to call it the <strong>Best Gaming Router 2017</strong>.</div>

<p>If you are looking for a router that has a classy, aggressive design and is packed with features. The Asus RT-AC3200 is a win-win deal.</p>
<p>As you can tell, this is a tri-band router with a hefty price tag, but you should keep in mind that a number of features that are packed into this router alone are enough to justify the heavy price tag it comes with. With that said, if you are willing to spend your money on a router that will give you extremely good performance and a plethora of features that are a dream come true for a networking enthusiast, then check out all the details about the RT-AC3200 by Asus.</p>
<div class="su-tabs su-tabs-style-default my-custom-tabs" data-active="1"><div class="su-tabs-nav"><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Design</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Features</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">OpenVPN and NAS</span></div><div class="su-tabs-panes"><div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">The router looks quite similar to what you would expect from Asus, it sports 6 antennas that can be detachable and replaced by more capable ones, and even though the design alone can make a statement, it isn’t something that would be the selling point for this wonderful router. You should keep in mind that the router looks absolutely stunning, although a little bulky, the looks alone can make on fall in love with this.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">The RT-AC3200 is something that is built for network enthusiasts who enjoy the top-tier hardware, the router happens to be incredibly fast in almost all the tests we have done on it, and has a really good performance over Wi-Fi, with respectable range.</p>
<p>The router also has an incredible web interface that makes it easy to setup, however, newcomers should know that the extensive list of features might confuse them a bit.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">Last but not the least, another great thing about this router is that it can double up as an OpenVPN server or act as a NAS (Network Attached Storage) and you should be glad to know that it does a really good job at both.</div></div></div>
<div class="redb">Sadly, the router is a bit lacking on the LAN ports as it only happens to have 4 of them, but if you are at a place where not many devices are connected with Ethernet cables, then it shouldn’t be an issue.</div>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<div class="blueb">Overall, the Asus RT-AC3200 is an overkill for a normal consumer, however, at the same time, it’s a dream come true for any networking lover. The router is powerful, looks good, and has plenty of features that will have you coming back for more. With that said, if you’re not heavily interested in the AC3200 capabilities of this router, you can always go for a cheaper AC1900. Anyhow, the Asus RT-AC3200 is an amazing router that will serve you for a long time.</div>

<p>The next up on our list is the Amped Wireless RTA2600 Athena router, and as long as you don’t confuse it with the Greek goddess Athena, the router will not disappoint you. Although not that much expensive, the router is something that is built for the network enthusiasts, it might not have the bling of the other routers that we have reviewed, but it comes with plenty of features that should be enough for both the average consumer and people who are looking to have some more.</p>
<p>The router managed to fair pretty well in almost all the testing we did, although the router doesn’t have an awful lot of features like some of the other ones, but the ones it has are properly polished and don’t require you to spend countless hours trying to figure out what is what. The router control panel is incredibly responsive, and very easy when it comes to setting up.</p>
<p>The router also comes with powerful hardware that should keep it afloat without giving any performance issues. One thing we really love about this router is how nicely everything is packed in a compact design. Yes, unlike some other routers, this isn’t an absolute behemoth. With that said, the performance on all fronts was respectable enough, and there were no disconnections or whatsoever during our test run. You can even connect multiple devices via Wi-Fi and the performance will still remain stellar, perhaps that is one of the major selling points of the RTA2600 Athena.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<div class="blueb">The wireless router is easily one of the best we have used and definitely makes it to the best wifi routers 2017 list. With that said, this might not be the number one pick for hardcore network enthusiasts but it is more than enough to keep things in order without making too much of a mess.</div>

<p>The next up on our list is a dual-band wireless router from Linksys, the router comes with the support for the AC1900 standard support; this means that the 5 gigahertz band has a speed of 1,300 megahertz and the 2.5 gigahertz band has a speed of 600 megahertz. But is this router capable enough of holding against most of the top tier routers that we have already listed? Let’s find out.</p>
<p>As soon as you will set your eyes on this router, you will be reminded of the classic design and color scheme that has been gracing the routers from Linksys for quite some time. With that said, if you are thinking about putting this router on a work desk that is already crammed up, you should know that you are going to need to clear some space as this is probably one of the largest routers we have seen in a long time.</p>
<p>The router has four antennas and the firmware it ships with can be replaced by a completely custom firmware if the user is willing to. As soon as you take the router out of the box, you will experience that the router happens to be one of the fastest routers available in the market, it’s easy to set up and loaded with features. With that said, Linksys was kind enough to add a complete capability of doubling up this router as a NAS, however, that’s not the greatest thing, the greatest thing about this router is that the NAS performance is definitely unsurpassed when compared to all the other wireless routers we have been testing. Not to forget that it also supports <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5803975/what-is-upnp-and-how-do-i-use-it-to-stream-media-to-my-tv">UPnP (Universal Plug and Play)</a> and DLNA. Last but not the least, the performance on both bands is amazing, and the router performs without any hiccups.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even the Experts are in love with this wireless router. You can read the article by <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2457009,00.asp">Samara Lynn on PCMag</a>. It is rated as Excellent and given 4.5 Rating.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<div class="blueb">So is this router perfect? Apart from some minor subjective flaws like a huge, bulky designs, there isn’t much to write bad about. The router emerged victorious in almost all the testing we have done and managed to perform without crashing on us. The software experience might confuse those who are not experts and at the same time, might be lacking for network enthusiasts. With that said, if you have the money, and you’re looking for a capable router, this one’s your best bet.</div>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BUSDVBQ/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-323 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TP-LINK-Archer-C7-Review.jpg" alt="TP-LINK Archer C7 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>TP-LINK Archer C7 AC1750 is the best budget wifi router out there <strong>(Under $100).</strong></p>
<p>The router is perfect for people who want to enjoy internet gaming as well as streaming, thanks to the fact that this router has a combined speed of 1.75 Gbps.</p>
<p>With that said, the router is both stylish and incredible at every task thrown at it, and for those who are looking for the perfect price and performance ratio, the router is an amazing choice.</p>
<div class="redb">Considering how it is an entry level router, the build quality isn’t all that good and the router seems flimsy, with that said, make sure that you don’t end up dropping the router because it can, and will probably get damaged. And even though the build quality seems to be average at best, the router has a large footprint, so make sure that where you place the router, it has enough space for itself.</div>
<p>Moving on to the thing that matter, keep in mind that it happens to be a dual-band router; the router has a total of 6 antennas, 3 of them are external while the remaining 3 are internal. The increased number of antennas are really good for giving you a respectable amount of Wi-Fi range and the speed also happens to be respectable enough. The router also comes with NAS capability, but don’t get too excited as it is only average.</p>
<div id="visualizer-1096-1981039173" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-1096"></div>
<div class="blueb">What’s lacking is that despite the price you are going to pay for the router, you won’t be getting an awful lot of features. But then again, TP-Link aimed this router towards the entry level and budget oriented consumers who just want to have a good wireless router with decent enough performance when it comes to streaming and online gaming with great ease.</div>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J8NCVX4/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-324 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/D-Link-DIR-880L-Review.jpg" alt="D-Link DIR-880L Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>Let’s just consider it a younger, yet excellent sibling of the DIR-890 that we reviewed earlier. There are quite some changes when compared to the DIR-890, for instance, this one happens to be a dual band router. But is it even worthy? As a matter of fact, according to our testing, this router manages to outperform the much expensive elder brother and has a lot of refined features that are both easy to use and come without a hassle. So how much difference there is between both routers from D-Link? Let’s find out.</p>
<p>The router has the same design you would expect from a D-Link router, if you are concerned about having detachable antennas, then don’t worry. All the antennas can easily be detached, and replaced with ones that will provide you higher Wi-Fi range. With that said, thanks to the detachable antennas, the router is actually very compact. Another great feature about this router is that it can be remotely managed via the cloud service that is being provided by D-Link, and although it may seem like a gimmick to some, it is actually a very useful feature, especially if you are in a different room than the router itself.</p>
<p>With that said, the parts that represent the performance are actually really amazing. Testing revealed that this is perhaps a good router, the performance on both bands was amazing, and the Wi-Fi range managed to impress us. As for the transfer rates, they managed to be perfect, and we didn’t find any sort of disconnection or slow speeds.</p>
<div class="redb">The only downside of this router is that the web interface is a bit of a surprise for both the newcomers and people who have been using D-Link routers for a long time.</div>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<div class="blueb">At this point, it would be safe to conclude that perhaps one of the best router on the list and definitely one of the best wireless routers is the DIR-880L by D-Link. It happens to prefer both style and substance, and doesn’t sacrifice one for the other.</div>

<p>The last in our list is all the way from Apple.</p>
<p>For those who are wondering if this router made it here by accident, then don’t. Apple has a wireless router, and it’s pretty good. The router is unconventionally named AirPort Extreme Base Station. So, how does this router fair against other routers in the list? Well, let’s find out, shall we?</p>
<p>Let’s start off by how this router looks. Why? Because obviously, this is something coming out of Apple’s very own helm, and you should know that the router looks exactly like something that will be made by Apple. With that said, and looks apart, the router is actually very capable and performs really well. Do keep in mind that it is a dual band router and supports the latest Wi-Fi standards as well. The router is incredibly fast in all the tests thrown at it, another great thing about this router is the amount of Wi-Fi stability and speed it provides. To be very honest, Apple truly outdid themselves with this router as it has everything on the right spot.</p>
<p>As for the downsides of this router, there aren’t any that will make you reconsider your decision of buying this router. The only complaint we have is that the router could have been a proper upgrade over its predecessors, but it wasn’t, and although it is quite fast and amazing, the upgrades seemed subjective.</p>
<h3>Final Verdict</h3>
<div class="blueb">Finally, the router is probably one of the best routers from Apple till date, it offers fast and stable performance and doesn’t create any issues.</div>

<h2>Wireless Router Buyer&#8217;s Guide</h2>
<div class="redb">If you keep the aforementioned points in mind, you can easily go out to the market and buy a wireless router, right? <strong>Hell No!</strong></div>
<p>For those who don’t know, wireless routers come with several things you need to consider before you actually spend the hard earned money. They have different available speeds as well as different WiFi standards and support for multiple bands.</p>
<h2>The technology behind a wireless Router?</h2>
<p>Every wireless router basically consists of three major points, the router itself, a network switch and a wireless access point.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>router</strong> basically serves the purpose of managing and directing traffic to the different devices connected to your network, in simpler terms, a router is responsible for sending data from your network to the other networks out there.</li>
<li>As for the <strong>network switch</strong>, the purpose of a network switch is to connect all your devices that are running WiFi to other wired devices using Ethernet cables.</li>
<li>Lastly, a <strong>wireless access point</strong> is just a simple station that has an antenna and the only job of a wireless access point is to transmit and receive wireless signals.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-280" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/best-wireless-router-2016.jpg" alt="best wireless routers 2016" width="800" height="300" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/best-wireless-router-2016.jpg 800w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/best-wireless-router-2016-300x113.jpg 300w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/best-wireless-router-2016-768x288.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>To make things easier for you below is the list of &#8220;<strong>wireless routers type</strong>&#8221; you will encounter in the market along with their brief descriptions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dual Band Routers:</strong> Perhaps the most common type of routers are dual band routers, if you are wondering why they got such a name, it’s because these routers operate on 2 different frequencies; 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz. They also happen to be the cheapest type of wireless routers available.</li>
<li><strong>Tri-Band Routers:</strong> These routers are comparatively newer in the market and offer three bands; two of the bands are 5 gigahertz and one happens to be the 2.4 gigahertz band. Considering how these routers are still new in the market, they are consistently introducing new and new technologies with the passage of time.</li>
<li><strong>N600 Routers:</strong> For those who don’t know, the N600 routers are the routers that have a combined speed of 600 Mbps; the speed is then evenly split between the 2.4 gigahertz and the 5 gigahertz band. They are comparatively old but are known to get the job done. However, they aren’t suggested for the modern high-speed internet.</li>
<li><strong>N900 Routers:</strong> These routers are the upgraded versions of the N600 routers, these routers have a combined speed of 900 Mbps that is evenly divided between the 2.4 and the 5 gigahertz bands.</li>
</ul>
<div class="su-tabs su-tabs-style-default my-custom-tabs" data-active="1"><div class="su-tabs-nav"><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">AC1750 Routers</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">AC1900 Routers</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">AC3200 Routers</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">AC5300 Routers</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">DD-WRT Routers</span></div><div class="su-tabs-panes"><div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">Compared to the previously mentioned routers, these offer a combined high speed of 1750 Mbps, however, the speed of these routers isn’t evenly split. The 2.4 gigahertz band gets a speed of 450 Mbps, and the 5 gigahertz band gets the remaining 1,300 Mbps speed.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">When compared to the AC1750 routers, these are quite similar, however, they offer a higher speed of 600 Mbps the 2.4 gigahertz, and the same 1,300 Mbps speed on the 5 gigahertz band.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">These routers start drifting towards the tri-band territory; they have a combined speed of 3,200 Mbps, 2,600 Mbps is evenly split between the two 5 gigahertz bands, and the remaining 600 Mbps is dedicated to the 2.4 gigahertz band.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">Perhaps the latest offering in the market is the AC5300 routers; these routers have a combined speed of 5,300 Mbps or 5.3 Gbps. The speed alone makes them the fastest and the most expensive routers that are currently available in the market.</p>
<p>However, there are no Clients (PCs, Laptops, Mobile Devices) available in the market which can support that much speed. So we can say  that AC5300 is offering a speed which is useless for now.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">These routers are comparatively different than the ones we have mentioned before. As compared to all the other wireless routers, the DD-WRT compliant routers use a Linux based third party firmware and has a lot of features that are missing from the ordinary routers. DD-WRT routers are basically like phones that are rooted or phones that are jailbroken.</div></div></div>
<p>With said, there are limitless options available when it comes to finding the wireless routers in today’s day and age, the market is quite saturated and every manufacturer is trying their best to bring up the best possible router there for consumers to enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Here I&#8217;m also going to include some FAQs about Wireless Routers.</strong></p>
<div class="su-accordion">
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>A wireless Router is a mundane device?</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">From the looks of it, a wireless router is a rather mundane device, and even though it may have some looks to it, the overall concept will be boring to people who have no interest in knowing how these things work.</div></div>
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>What is the biggest advantage?</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">However, if you happen to be a networking enthusiast like me, a wireless router can mean a great thing to you.</p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of a wifi router is that they can connect your internet with a number of different devices, and all of that without the need of a modem. If you are wondering which devices you can connect, almost all of the devices that have a WiFi chip inside them can be connected to the internet via a wireless router.</div></div>
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Why people buy cheap routers?</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">A lot of people live on the theory that a good wireless router isn’t something they need, in such case, they prefer to stick to a $50 router and denies that a more expensive router is basically just shedding some extra money.</div></div>
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Why you need to buy Modern and Advanced Wi-fi router?</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">The actual story is different.</p>
<p>When you are in the market to purchase a wireless router, there are a lot of things you should keep in mind, you should know that a better, more expensive wireless router will always be ahead of a cheaper one in almost every task you throw at it. Be it playing games over the internet, streaming videos, or making Skype calls. An expensive wireless router will do these jobs better than the cheaper one.</p>
<p><strong>Do keep in mind that your network speed must also be good in order for things to work properly.</strong></div></div></div>
<h2>Advantages and Functionalities of Modern and Advanced Wifi Routers</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-291" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Modern-wifi-routers-2016.jpg" alt="Modern wifi routers 2016" width="800" height="300" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Modern-wifi-routers-2016.jpg 800w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Modern-wifi-routers-2016-300x113.jpg 300w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Modern-wifi-routers-2016-768x288.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Most modern wireless routers have the ability to provide you with a unique IP address for all the devices you connect to the internet, since how the IP address is unique and not available to public; your network will not be prone to get hacked.</li>
<li>A good wireless router will always be easy to set up with features that are easy to understand and intuitive. A good wireless router will also make sure that the use of cables is as less as possible in order to stay true to its legacy.</li>
<li>For people who are into <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">NAS (Network Attached Storage)</a></strong> many flagship wireless routers come with the support for external hard drive, this means that you can easily plug in your external hard drive to the port that is available on the wireless router.</li>
<li>Most of the top of the line wireless routers come with the support of <strong>DLNA</strong>, for those who don’t know, DLNA is basically a technology that you can use to have a proper control over how audio, video, and media is handled over the network you are using.</li>
<li>Last but not the least, most high-end routers also come with some additional advantages like the prioritization of networks, the ability to do shared printing over the USB, parental control as well backup servers for important data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final Words &#8211; Wrapping it up</h2>
<p>Considering how the market of wireless routers is pretty saturated, finding the perfect wireless router is never an easy task. That’s when lists like these come into play. The list was carefully crafted, keeping in mind things like the needs of a customer and how much are they willing to spend on a wireless router.</p>
<p>We hope the list helps you pick the best wireless router according to your budget. Do keep in mind that there’s no such thing as a “perfect” component, that’s why each router is built to suit the need of different consumers. We have added routers that are for budget oriented consumers as well as the routers that are for networking elites.

<p>Yes, even for people who do not have enough valid reasons to invest in drones would want to buy. Right? &#8230;</p>
<p>You should also keep in mind that while the drones are super cool, they also happen to be quite expensive, and are often made for enthusiasts, or people who are into experimenting with videography mainly because almost all the good, high-end drones come equipped with amazing cameras.</p>
<h2>Best Drone Cameras 2017</h2>
<p>There are some things you should know about, the drone market is divided into 2 parts; there are the high level, enthusiast grade drones like the DJI Phantom 4, and the DJI T600 Inspire 1, and then there are cheaper options.</p>
<div class="redb">
<p>Now as for the cheaper options, they cost way lower than what you’d expect to pay for a DJI Phantom 4, or other similar competitive products, however, at the same time, these products are considered toy drones. Keeping that in mind, you should know that we went ahead and covered both types because we didn’t want to be prejudiced towards a certain type of drone than the other.</p>
<p>So, you will be seeing some really high-end stuff from the likes of DJI, and GoPro as well as some entry-level toy drones that are targeted towards people who just want to have some fun.</p>

<p><strong>Before we begin, you should know that these drones are also commonly known as Quadcopters due to their appearance and rotors on all 4 ends.</strong></p>
<div class="yb">
<p>There are majorly 2 different type of drones/quadcopters, there is the type that comes without any camera preinstalled or a camera mount that you can use to put a camera there, and then there are the ones that are equipped with really high-end cameras that can shoot videos at 4K.</p>
<p>Now if you just want to have a drone that you can fly around, and show off, you can get the simple one that won’t cost you much. However, if you are a film student or an aspiring filmmaker, and you are looking for something with a high-end camera, you should be prepared to spend a lot of money because drones that come equipped with high-end cameras are really expensive.</p>

<h2>1. <a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/go/dji-mavic-pro/" name="op1">DJI Mavic Pro</a> &#8211; Best Portable Drone (Casey Neistat&#8217;s Favourite)</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/go/dji-mavic-pro/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1154 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/DJI-Mavic-Pro-Review.jpg" alt="DJI Mavic Pro Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>The first drone camera on our list is the famous DJI Mavic Pro.</p>
<p>Now in case you don’t know, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPG1Xa5Uqwo">Casey Neistat</a> himself endorsed this drone on several occasion and went on saying that this is quite possibly the best drone he has had the chance to use, and that is saying something.</p>
<p>Before we begin, you should know that <a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/go/dji/">Dà-Jiāng Innovations Science and Technology Co</a>. (commonly known as DJI) is a Chinese company that specializes in creating some of the best drones we have seen in the market, they are really famous for their Phantom lineup, something we will be seeing on our list today, and in addition to that, they have some other lineups like Inspire. Needless to say, the company has made sure that it has drones suitable for all sorts of consumers.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>During our entire testing process, we found out that DJI Mavic Pro is, in fact, one of the best drones we have used, and we are going to tell you why is the case.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, let’s take a look at the DJI Mavic Pro, and apart from the pros, we are even going to take a look at some of the things that hold this otherwise amazing drone back.</p>
</div>
<p>The DJI Mavic Pro is super compact, and in case you are wondering how that’s possible, that’s because the drone can be folded, and the size becomes as similar as a small bottle of water, that’s why it’s the top choice, and can be carried pretty much anywhere you want. Other than that, Mavic Pro comes with something very special that is known as OcuSync transmission system; the transmission system gives the drone a transmission range of up to 4.3 miles (7km) of allowing the controller to fly the drone at an impressive speed of 40mph (64km/h).</p>
<div class="blueb">
<p>The DJI Mavic Pro comes with special features such as ActiveTrack, and TapFly; these features are there to make sure that your video shooting goes perfectly well along with the brilliant 4K capable camera allowing you to shoot high-quality images with great ease.</p>
<p>Other feature that lets the drone’s camera see objects coming its way and easily avoids them, this combined with sensor redundancy gives you unmatched flight safety along with reliability.</p>
</div>
<p>It also has something known as vision positioning technology that works in parallel with GPS and GLONASS making sure that the positioning remains precise whether you are indoor or outdoor. Thanks to the advanced sensors and tech, you can easily control the DJI Mavic with your phone with the help of WiFi, this is really good, especially when you’re feeling lazy indoors and want to play with the drone.</p>

<h2>2. <a href="https://shop.gopro.com/International/karma" rel="nofollow" name="op2">GoPro Karma</a> &#8211; Another Legendary Drone from GoPro</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.gopro.com/International/karma" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1159 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GoPro-Karma.jpg" alt="GoPro Karma Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>The next drone on our list may come as a surprise to some of you, and the reason is quite simple.</p>
<p>GoPro is basically this really good company that has created active cameras for ages, these small cameras are powerful enough to record videos at true 4K, they can be taken anywhere, and mounted to pretty much anything.</p>
<p>Needless to say, GoPro has singlehandedly dominated the active camera market, and while there have been a lot of competitors, nothing has managed to come close to the amazing cameras by GoPro.</p>
<div class="yb">Considering their expertise in the “active” industry, GoPro has decided to jump into the drone industry as well and released the GoPro Karma. Now a lot of eyebrows were raised about the Karma, and people were still in doubt up until Casey Neistat showed up with the first ever hands-on video, and showed just how impressive, and fast the GoPro Karma is.</div>
<p>With all the good things aside, you should know that the review is completely based on the earlier opinions of the prototype version, with that said, we don’t doubt the capabilities and prowess of the GoPro Karma at all. In our personal opinion, if there’s any drone to challenge DJI Mavic Pro, it’s the Karma by GoPro.</p>
<p>Just like the DJI Mavic Pro, the GoPro Karma is extremely portable thanks to the fact that the wings can fold into the drone itself, making it easier to carry around. The Karma is extremely easy to operate for both seasoned flyers as well as newcomers, thanks to the easy to understand control schemes, and an intuitive UI. The drone comes with an app named GoPro Passenger, this app lets your friends view your drone fly, and even control the GoPro as they wish to.</p>
<p>Apart from the built-in camera, the GoPro Karma actually supports a number of different GoPro cameras including the Hero 4, Hero 5 Black, and Hero Session. The drone ships with a GoPro Karma grip in order to have the best possible, and smoothest video recordings.</p>

<h2>3. <a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/go/dji-phantom-4/" name="op3">DJI Phantom 4</a> &#8211; Best Professional Drone in this List</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/go/dji-phantom-4/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1163 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DJI-Phantom-4-Review.jpg" alt="DJI Phantom 4 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>We are taking a step down and going to talk about some of the legends now.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the only reason it is not in our Top position because of it&#8217;s huge, big and bulky design which makes it less portable as compared to Mavic or Karma. Other than that, this is the most polished and professional Camera Drone out there.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, the DJI Phantom 4 is perhaps the <strong>most popular drone</strong> that is currently available to buy in the market. In case you are wondering how good this is, Casey Neistat has been using this drone, and as a matter of fact, he has a total of 7 Phantom 4s with him.</p>
<p>With that said, that should be one reason to buy the drone, however, for those who are looking for more than just personal preference, don’t worry, we have you covered. We managed to get our hands on the DJI Phantom 4, and our testing process revealed that this is, in fact, one of the best drones that are available in the market. In case you are wondering what made it so good, check out our complete review below.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>The DJI Phantom 4 comes with the ability to takeoff as well as the ability to come back home on its own, all of this thanks to the brilliant GPS technology. The Phantom 4 is extremely easy to operate and comes with an app that lets you control, and monitor all the brilliant camera operations with great ease and convenience.The camera on the Phantom 4 is extremely well made, and can easily let the user capture videos in 4K at 30 fps. In addition to that, the camera also supports the maximum resolution of 12 megapixels in photos.</p>
<p>The camera has an impressive f/2.8 lens that offers a rather wider field of few for people who want extremely crisp, well detailed, and clear pictures. It also comes with a technology known as Gimbal stabilization technology, this technology is good enough to offer users a great hover function, along with the ability to capture brilliant footage even when the drone is in the air and moving around.</p>
<p>Users can use the included DJI director software that has a built-in video editor in order to edit their video as they please; the editor lets you add text, music, and a couple of other options as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="redb">Although beautiful, the Phantom 4 is only available in white color, something that may put off potential buyers. Battery life isn’t as good as we would want it to be, and the drone is quite expensive.</div>
<p>So, there you have it. Is the DJI Phantom 4 a good option for those who are looking to spend top of the line money?</p>
<p>Yes, as a matter of fact, it is one of the best drones we have used in a long, long time. It lives up to the amazing legacy that has been created by DJI, and that’s something to say. In case you are wondering if we have any complaints with the drone, well, there is one downside to the DJI Phantom, but that’s totally subjective, still, for those who are willing to know, the negative point is mentioned below.</p>

<h2>4. <a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/go/dji-inspire-1/" name="op4">DJI Inspire 1</a> &#8211; Professional yet Expensive</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/go/dji-inspire-1/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1164 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DJI-Inspire1-Review.jpg" alt="DJI Inspire1 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>The next drone on our list is another one from DJI, and this one is called the DJI T600 Inspire 1; this drone actually comes with the option to be controlled with 2 controllers, and there’s one that only has 1 control with it. It’s all up to you.</p>
<p>Now in case you didn’t know, this drone also comes with a 4K video camera, and it actually is really good for video recording; perfect for people who are experimenting with videography, and love to record high-quality videos that are brimming with details, colors, and sharpness. Now, as compared to the DJI Phantom 4, this one has a different design, and it’s actually more aggressive than the Phantom 4 as well. With that said, that doesn’t make it a bad drone as it is one of the best ones out in the market. So, without further ado, let’s take a look at the advantages that made the DJI T600 Inspire 1 one of our favorite drones.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no denying that the DJI T600 Inspire 1 is actually one of the best drones we have seen in a long time, it is surely an expensive one, and can get even more expensive if you are willing to get the one that comes with 2 controllers, but other than that, there’s no denying that the drone is simply amazing. Believe it or not, it can actually take on the Phantom 4. If you’re wondering whether or not we encounter some downsides with the T600 Inspire 1, you should know that we have, though they are not deal breakers, they are still there.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>The T600 Inspire 1 comes with a ready to fly system, which means that everything you need to fly this beautiful drone is already added in the box. All you need to complete your experience is a mobile phone or a screen and you will get a live HD view of the beautiful capturing. The arms on the DJI T600 Inspire one are made out of really strong fiber, these arms remain completely out of sight, which means that all of your video recordings will go smoothly, and you won’t be seeing the arms interfere the videos at all. The camera on the DJI T600 Inspire 1 is capable of shooting videos at 4K and has the ability to take crystal clear, sharp, and very detailed photos at 12 megapixels, this makes the Inspire 1 one of the best drones for photographers as well as videographers.</p>
<p>Users can easily remove the gimbal and the camera system from the T600 Inspire 1; this allows the user to easily upgrade in future, or simply have the whole drone carried safely from one place to another.</p>
<p>The drone can easily be connected to your mobile phone in order to provide you a real-time, live feed straight from the drone’s camera onto your phone; the video is viewed on your phone in 720p, and a great feature for those who want to be fully aware of how the recording is going on. While the professionals will obviously love the drone as it is, newcomers will be glad to know that the drone is extremely easy to setup, and even easier to fly once you have the proper hold of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="redb">Sadly, as good as the flying experience of the DJI T600 Inspire 1 is, the battery life is terrible, and the drone only managed to last us 18 minutes on full charge. Separate accessories such as the controller, and the battery can hike the price of this drone drastically.</div>

<h2>5. <a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/go/dji-phantom-3-pro/" name="op5">DJI Phantom 3 (PROFESSIONAL)</a> &#8211; One of the Best Aerial Videography Quadcopter</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/go/dji-phantom-3-pro/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1166 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DJI-Phantom-3-Professional-Review.jpg" alt="DJI Phantom 3 Professional Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>There is no denying that the DJi’s Phantom series of drones have become sort of a benchmark for the top of the line consumer drones, although they are made with consumers in mind, they are equally alluring for the most professionals out there.</p>
<p>In case you don’t know, the popular YouTuber/filmmaker Casey Niestat has been using the DJI Phantom 4 as his primary drone for shooting a lot of quality footage ever since the drone first came out. With that said, today, we are not looking at the Phantom 4, instead, we will be looking at its younger brother that is known as the DJI Phantom 3 Professional. Now when you compare this to the older brother, not much has changed in terms of the looks, however, the Phantom 3 Professional has a bit of a flashier design thanks to the golden accents. However, in case you are wondering about the accents ruining the simplicity of the drone, don’t. They actually complement the drone nicely and are certainly a welcomed addition.</p>
<p>We had the DJI Phantom 3 Professional in our hands for quite some time, and while we were a bit skeptical, we found out some really good things, as well as some minor issues about the drone. However, we are going to take a look at all the good things about this drone. Below you will have all the amazing features that make DJI Phantom 3 Professional such an amazing camera drone to buy. Sadly, much like the other drones, we have seen on the list, this one is also plagued with the familiar issues that we are so used to see. What are those issues, you ask? Well, let’s check them out below, but first, let’s take a look at the pros.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>The DJI Phantom 3 Professional is very, very easy to setup, and is a delight to fly even for the beginners as well as the professionals. The camera on the Phantom 3 Professional is one of the best 4K cameras we have seen; it produces crisp, clear videos that are brimming with details. It is also equipped with vision positioning system that allows the indoor flights to be super smooth, and without any issues. The drone comes with a feature known as the Lightbridge digital streaming, this feature allows the user to live stream 720p videos on the internet, while the full-size video is being recorded and stored internally.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, the Phantom 3 Professional comes with an iOS and Android-compatible application that lets you control the camera, as well as have a live view of everything that is being recorded by the camera on your phone.</p>
</div>
<div class="redb">Unsurprisingly, the DJI Phantom 3 Professional comes at a hefty price regardless of how you buy it (with or without the accessories bundle). Much like every other drone we have seen on the list, the DJI Phantom 3 Professional also comes with a mediocre battery life that lasts somewhere around 20 minutes on a single charge, and buying a spare battery only racks up the cost.</div>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E0ER9WI/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-1167 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Yuneec-Q500-4K-Review.jpg" alt="Yuneec Q500 4K Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>We are taking a step away from DJI, and looking at some other options, the next offering we have at our hands is the Yuneeq Q500 4K, and the proper name for this beautiful drone is Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon.</p>
<p>With that said, one can assume that this was made as a direct competition to other drones on our list, and especially the ones from DJI, and it actually can be considered a competition. The drone comes in a stylish carrying case that is oddly large. For those who aren’t too fond of the white, sober looks of the DJI Phantom series drones, you should be glad to know that this one comes donned in black, something Batman would have loved. Still, not a lot of love has been lost as this is one of the prettiest drones we have had the chance to use. Sadly, we can’t really let the looks decide just how good the drone is, so that’s why we decided to put the Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon through the paces in order to see just how good it is. Just like before, we will be keeping our focus on the good things before we take a look at the things that are not so appealing. So, without further wasting any more time, let’s take a look at the good things about the Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon.</p>
<p>From the looks, it may seem that the Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon is actually better than the competition, especially with the competitive price, but doesn’t exist without its flaws. In case you are wondering, there are some obvious flaws to the drone, and we are going to see which ones there are. So, there you have the complete rundown on the Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon, whether or not you are going to buy it, is up to you. However, we did notice that even with all the handsome features, it’s still cheaper than most of the competition, and that is certainly a good thing.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon is capable of offering a smooth, and completely stable 4K video recording that is all nice, sharp, colorful, and brimming with details; the 12 megapixels camera does a great job at capturing amazing stills, and the distortion-free lens proves to be more than just a gimmick. The camera can be used separately and attached to a handgrip included that can be used to take the same beautiful footage and photos on the ground as well. Unlike some other drone controllers, the controller on the Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon is actually based on an all-in-one concept; the controller features a screen that provides you with a first person view of the drone using the camera, along with the ability to access camera controls straight from the screen.</p>
<p>The drone ships with a large carrying case, and has 2 spare batteries that you can use; do keep in mind that you can buy the same drone without the 2 added batteries for a cheaper price. Apart from being controlled through the built-in remote, the Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon can also be controlled through the super compact Wizard remote control. The drone is competitively priced and is cheaper than most of the direct competition with or without the battery bundle.</p>
</div>
<div class="redb">While the drone itself looks pretty compact, there’s no proper way to put it in something apart from the rather large carrying case, making it not so travel-friendly. As sad as it may seem, the Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon comes without any support for the famous waypoint navigation.</div>

<h2>7. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZPM7BOG/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" name="op7">3D Robotics Solo</a> &#8211; The Best drone for the Money</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZPM7BOG/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-1186 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3D-Robotics-Solo-Review.jpg" alt="3D Robotics Solo Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>You may be wondering why have we drifted apart from the famous companies like GoPro and DJI and now are focusing more on the underdogs, well that’s because they aren’t getting a lot of attention, and we are about to change that.</p>
<p>The next Drone/Quadcopter on our list is 3D Robotics Solo, and while the name happens to be very, very uninteresting, the drone certainly isn’t. In case you are wondering, just like the Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon, this drone is also heavily focused on the price to performance ratio, which means that the buyers will be getting more out of the drone for every dollar they will be spending on it.</p>
<div class="blueb">
<p>Now before we begin reviewing this drone, you should know that the consumer drone market is currently divided into 2 parts; one part is dominated by the drones that come with their own cameras installed, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> part is the part in which drones are using the top of the line GoPro cameras.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering which category does the 3D Robotics Solo belongs to, it’s the second one as it does let you attach a GoPro, however, as per the Amazon listing, you would have to buy that separately. Something that is understandable because the drone costs almost 3 times less than the DJI Phantom 4, and still manages to be one of the best drones in the market.</p>
<p>However, if you want everything right at the spot, you can spend extra (still less expensive than the competition) and get the Gimbal bundle that will give you pretty much everything you need, along with a carrying case that you can use to house your drone in.</p>
</div>
<p>With that said, enough chatter about the camera features, and the pricing, let’s see how the 3D Robotics Solo managed to hold out in our testing process.</p>
<p>The drone offers one of the best industrial designs we have seen and comes with complete Gimbal support means that it gets the superior stabilization as well as support most of our beloved drones are known for. The 3D Robotics Solo has a return to home safety feature which allows the drone to return to the position it took off from thanks to the GPS system.</p>
<p>Although the drone ships with a remote control with a powerful 1 GHz processor inside, you can control the drone using an app that is available on both iOS and Android. The ability to attach any camera is a definitely amazing option. The drone is extremely easy to learn and master and will make both hardcore, and newcomers feel right at home.</p>
<div class="redb">As good as the other features of this drone are, the GPS seems to be a bit slow, and can have an issue finding the right positioning. Pretty much like any other drone we have reviewed, the battery life suffers.</div>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FS7SV1U/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-1187 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Parrot-AR.Drone-2.0-Review.jpg" alt="Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next drone on our list is something entirely different from the rest, it’s not as big as your go to drones that you can buy in the market, making it perhaps one of the smallest drones we have seen with the rotors attached.</p>
<p>That’s not all, where other drones follow a very aggressively placed design language, the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 actually has a way different design language, instead of going all out, the design is very, very held back, and resembles a flying saucer instead. Whether or not that adds or removes anything from the overall aerodynamics, we are not too sure about that. With that said, for those who are wondering about how much the drone costs, you’d be glad to know that it is very, very competitively priced, and that is completely understandable considering how this drone isn’t really built for professional photographers or filmmakers. Still, that doesn’t mean this drone isn’t good enough.</p>
<p>Now before we begin taking an in-depth look at the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0, we would like to address some confusions; unlike the other drones in our list that are actual, consumer grade, professional drones. The Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 is actually a toy drone, and while you are still getting a camera, it’s not 4K capable, and certainly not made for professional photography. However, you should also keep it in mind that despite the fact that it is more of a toy drone than a full-sized drone, it’s still really, really good, and will provide you countless hours of fun provided you charge it after the battery ends. Another thing you need to keep in mind is this drone doesn’t come with physical controls, and in order to physically control the drone, you require a Nvidia Shield. However, you can still fly the drone using the app with your own smartphone.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 is a nice middle ground between toy and enthusiast device. It&#8217;s not a remote controlled helicopter for hobbyists and it&#8217;s not a quadricopter camera mount for professionals, but it&#8217;s much more than just a toy helicopter.</p>
<p>&#8211; Will Greenwald, <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2424345,00.asp">PCMag</a></p></blockquote>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s stop wasting time, and talk about the pros and the cons of the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>Incredibly simplistic controls make this drone a treat to fly; you can even perform stunts on your drone. Despite not having a high-end camera, the 2 built-in cameras provide plenty of fun functions that are fun to explore and try out. While you need a Nvidia Shield in order to use the physical controls, the drone is highly easy to use even through the phone applications.</p>
<p>All the footage taken through the 2 built-in cameras get stored directly on the phone, something that is really cool. The drone is available in a multitude of different colors.</p>
</div>
<div class="redb">The battery life is expectedly short, pretty much like every other drone we have tested.</div>

<p>You may have noticed that as the list is coming towards its end, we are also beginning to explore drones that are actually way cheaper than some of the drones that we have reviewed in the start.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that we already stated that there will be a sudden shift, so in case you didn’t read the article properly, now you know what we are talking about.</p>
<p>Without wasting any more time, we are going to announce our latest product in line that is known as the Cheerson Hobby CX-20 Professional, now as you can tell by the name, this drone is more inclined towards the hobbyists, however, you should be glad to know that despite the drone not being shipped with a camera, there is a mount ready for a Go Pro that you can attach and start shooting footage at 4K, and taking brilliantly detailed pictures.</p>
<p>Now before we start digging deeper into the details, you should know that the Cheerson Hobby CX-20 Professional shares a close resemblance to the DJI Phantom series drones, and you shouldn’t be worried considering how you can still differentiate between the drones thanks to the red accents on this one. Although this particular drone is very competitively price, and one may think that it’s a toy drone, that’s not entirely true. The drone happens to be quite powerful and comes with a lot of advanced features including vision positioning system, and unlike the AR.Drone 2.0, it actually has a dedicated remote controller that you can use to properly control the drone.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s not waste any more time, and take a look at just how good the Cheerson Hobby CX-20 Professional is, weighing in on the pros as well as the cons.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>Comes with advanced features like vision positioning system, pathfinder, as well as auto-return home. The camera mount allows the user to add a Go Pro camera and shoot beautiful 4K footage, and clear stills.</p>
<p>Competitively priced without sacrificing on the build quality. Attractive white design with red accents on the body. Easy to learn, and fun to fly with full physical controls.</p>
</div>
<div class="redb">Plagued with shorter battery life, and longer battery charging time. Due to being relatively new, there isn’t much information available on finding spare parts.</div>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PYKOPDO/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-1189 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3d-Robotics-Iris-Review.jpg" alt="3d Robotics Iris+ Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>We are finally on the last product that will be going on the list, and just like the previous entries, this again is a drone made specifically for the hobbyist.</p>
<p>Meet the 3D Robotics Iris+, and while the name certainly sounds interesting, we were a bit skeptical about the drone being a mediocre, cheap drone, but to be fairly honest, the drone completely defined out expectations. The 3D Robotics Iris+ is one of the best drones we have used in the entire list, and there are actually a lot of reasons for that. For starters, the drone has a lot of features that are found in high-end drones like the DJI Phantom 4, and other similar drones that are still slightly more expensive.</p>
<p>So, what’s so special about the 3D Robotics Iris+? Well, to be honest, a lot of things, it actually looks better than some of the other drones in our list, and although it doesn’t come with a built-in camera, you can find a mount that you can use to put a Go Pro on your own choice, and shoot beautiful footage in 4K, and take stunning photos thanks to the camera mount you get. With that said, despite the fact that this drone is marketed as a toy, it’s not; the 3D Robotics Iris+ is a large, intimidating drone with a footprint that is as big as the flagship drones we have managed to test.</p>
<p>Some of the good things about the 3D Robotics Iris+ is that each of the arms have LEDs installed on them in order to give you a better understanding directionally, the 3D Robotics Iris+ comes in a bundle that includes several different accessories like a 4GB memory stick, replacement propellers, and spare battery as well. Anyway, without further ado, let’s take a look at the pros and the cons of the much loved and adored 3D Robotics Iris+.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>The drone is very, very stable when it comes to flying. There is no steep learning curve like some of the most common, high-end drones.</p>
<p>The drone becomes a lot capable as soon as you start adding the accessories that are sold separately. You can add pretty much any camera as long as it is compatible with the mounting system. The drone is also equipped with the highly useful and equally popular Gimbal tilt on control. Has a very useful return-to-launch function that works as advertised. Somewhat impressive battery life. The remote control provides you with real-life on-screen telemetry data as you fly.</p>
</div>
<div class="redb">Add-ons such as the camera Gimbal, as well as first-person view, are expensive. The drone doesn’t instantly power down and takes a few seconds for the motors to stop. Remote control can be a bit intimidating for beginners.</div>

<p><a name="bg"></a>So, there you have it.</p>
<p>Probably one of the most intimidating roundups considering how the market is literally flooded with drones; coming from both the elitist, enthusiast class drones as well as the hobbyist drones. There’s no denying that the market is very, very saturated, and it is perhaps the hardest thing to be able to buy a drone that fits all of your requirements. With that out of the way, you should know that the time is still very, very early for the drones to be fully functional, for instance, there are some rules that are being enforced on the use of drones, however, those are purely for the purpose of national safety.</p>
<div class="redb">
<p>In addition to that, the most common issue right now with pretty much every single drone out in the market is the battery life.</p>
<p>You see, despite having huge, heavy duty batteries, the drones fail to give a decent battery timing, and that is certainly in issue for people who want to have extended flight times. Still, considering how the drones are still developing in the market, and companies are focusing on more and on reducing the overall size, and seems like they will be succeeding in that department. For instance, the Go Pro Karma, as well as the DJI Mavic Pro are some of the most compact enthusiast level drones we have seen.</p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps the next evolution we may see would be the extend batteries, and considering how the best drone can last up to 30 minutes, having a drone that can utilize 2 batteries at the same time should theoretically and practically increase the battery time by double. Still, standing at this point, there is absolutely no denying that the future of drones is certainly bright, and these drones have given a lot of benefits to aspiring photographers as well people who want to shoot some brilliant footage thanks to the ability to attach a GoPro camera; now combine that with the Gimbal system and you have got yourself a killer video making rig that can be really good for your personal projects.</p>
<p>With that said, our last words would be that testing so many drones, each with their own setup and learning curve was certainly not an easy thing, however, we tried our best to assess the situation by making sure we cover every single aspect of a drone, and tell you what’s wrong with, and what’s not.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are a fan of racing simulators or racing games in general, then it is safe to say that you already own a xBox steering wheel for your xBox or the platform of your choice. It is either that or you are actually planning on buying one but you are confused because of the sheer saturation of the market. Be aware that is okay to be confused with such trivial methods, after all, chances are that this is your first time buying a steering wheel.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, there’s a good news for you; the market is filled with wonderful steering wheels from all sorts of manufacturers.</p>
<p>You have <a href="http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/gaming-controllers">Logitech</a> , Thrustmaster and some other very trustworthy brands that have been making the top of the line steering wheels as well as other great peripherals.</p>
<h2>Best xBox Steering Wheel 2017</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-614 size-full" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/xbox-Steering.jpg" alt="xBox Steering Wheel" width="800" height="300" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/xbox-Steering.jpg 800w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/xbox-Steering-300x113.jpg 300w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/xbox-Steering-768x288.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Today, we are going to help you selecting the best Xbox steering wheel you can buy currently in the market. For your ease and convenience, we have listed quite a number of them and left you with their pros and cons as well.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let’s take a look at the best Xbox steering wheels 2017.</p>
<h2>1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Z0UWV98/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Logitech G920 Driving Force</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Z0UWV98/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-601 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Logitech-G920-Driving-Force-Review.jpg" alt="Logitech G920 Driving Force Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>We are starting the list by adding the Logitech G920 Driving Force, for those who don’t know, this racing steering wheel is specifically designed for the Xbox.</p>
<p>However, if you are interested, Logitech released the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Z0UWWYC/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Driving Force G29</a>, that has full support for PC, PS3, and PS4. With that out of the way, before we begin, you should keep in mind that the G920 is an elite class steering wheel that one can use, it has the class and the power to prove it.</p>
<p>The wheel itself is quite classy, yet maintains a certain flash to itself, the buttons are perfectly placed, and one of the best thing about this is that it can easily fit in almost all places. However, players who have actual cockpits for playing this amazing racing game would be glad to know that it works rather well.</p>
<p>At such a point, the only one concern we have with the steering wheel itself is the price itself, the steering wheel costs about $350 if you buy it without a shifter, and if you purchase the shifter, the price goes to above $400.</p>
<p><strong>But considering how Logitech has provided us with a near perfect product, the price is understandable.</strong></p>

<h2>2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IVHQ0KI/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Thrustmaster VG Ferrari</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IVHQ0KI/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-605 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Thrustmaster-VG-Ferrari-Review.jpg" alt="Thrustmaster VG Ferrari Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next up on the list is Thrustmaster VG Ferrari steering wheel that is designed specifically for Xbox One. Before we begin, we would like to point out that this steering wheel is so far the cheapest offering we have on the list as it retails for just $90. Yes, that’s right. So how does it fare against the beasts like Logitech G920 and G29? In all honesty, the comparison would be a bit unfair. Let’s find out what the VG Ferrari has in store for us.</p>
<p>Straight out of the box, the steering wheel gives you the top of the line impression of a Ferrari, keep in mind that the design language of Ferrari can be found all over the place. We had our doubts about the build quality because of the price it comes with, but believe it or not, the steering wheel surpassed all the expectations we had, it offers a solid construction and works in every racing game or games that contain driving.</p>
<p>The few issues that we have had with the VG Ferrari are mostly the lack of extra options found in the other racing wheels, and even though the construction feels really solid, it has a cheap, plastic feel to it. But then again, do keep in mind that you are paying $90 for it, and it is as good as things get.</p>
<p>I also recommend you to have a look at <a href="https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/review-xbone-thrustmaster-vg-ferrari-458-spider-racing-wheel.316437/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GTPlanet forum</a>, what they have to say about this xbox steering wheel.</p>

<h2>3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0057OW94E/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mad Catz Wireless Force</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0057OW94E/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-607 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Mad-Catz-Wireless-Force-Review.jpg" alt="Mad Catz Wireless Force Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next up on our list is the Mad Catz Wireless Force, for those who don’t know, Mad Catz is one of the best brands when it comes to delivering 3<sup>rd</sup> party peripherals, they are already the fan favorite amongst the fans of games like Tekken and Street Fighter. So, how does their entry into the market of steering wheels fair? Well, you are about to find out.</p>
<p>This particular steering wheel is aptly named Wireless Force, and its key selling point is, of course, the fact that it is wireless. With that said, the Wireless Force carries the traditional looks and the built quality that Mad Catz is known for; the wheel itself is silver, and has black all around it, though regardless of the color scheme, the wheel looks quite solid. Moving on to the functionality, the Wireless Force performed actually well in almost all the tests we put it on. The wheel was put against something as serious as Forza Motorsport, and to test how good it performs in games that have an arcade-rescue driving style, we tested the wheel in GTA V and cruised around Los Santos in a number of different cars. Our thoughts? The steering wheel did a rather amazing job. The feedback was responsive as it gets and felt really powerful.</p>
<p>So with so many good things to write home about, do we have any issues with the wheel? Well, yes; although the construction of the wheel itself is amazing, the pedals feel like they are made out of cheap and low-quality metal, and lastly, although the steering wheel itself is wireless, you still need a power outlet to run it.</p>
<p>Other than the small gripes, the Wireless Force by Mad Catz is an amazing steering wheel that is built for comfortable and fun gaming. If you are looking for something under the sub $300 category, nothing could be better at such a price.</p>

<h2>4. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ENFVS5Y/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Thrustmaster TX Racing Wheel Ferrari 458</a> &#8211; Italia Edition</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ENFVS5Y/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-610 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Thrustmaster-Italia-Edition-Review.jpg" alt="Thrustmaster Italia Edition Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next up on the list is the aptly named TX Racing Wheel Ferrari 458 Italia Edition by Thrustmaster, for those who don’t know, this steering wheel comes in 2 editions; the Ferrari 458 Italia Edition, as well as the leather edition. We will be reviewing the leather edition later in this post, but for now, let’s stick to the Italia edition and see what Thrustmaster TX Racing Wheel Ferrari 458 Italia Edition has in stores for us.</p>
<p>As you would expect, the racing wheel comes with the iconic Ferrari branding in the middle, when it comes to looks, the steering wheel is quite minimalistic and doesn’t have any over the top elements, and without any surprises, it supports both Xbox One and PC. The construction of the steering wheel is pretty solid and it won’t be failing on you. However, having used both the leather edition and the Italia edition, it is safe to say that the leather edition has a lot more premium feel to it. However, you should keep in mind that where this one retails for about $300 give or take, the price for the leather edition is about a hefty $470, and that’s a $170 premium for some feel good materials.</p>
<p>The performance on the Thrustmaster TX Racing Wheel Ferrari 458 Italia Edition is no joke, the steering wheel performed absolutely well in almost all the games we tested it on, but for the readers, the games that we tested were; Grand Theft Auto V, GRID, Forza Motorsport, and a couple of others. You’d be glad to know that all of the games worked perfectly fine without any major problems. Also, if you are anxious to know how good or bad the force feedback and vibration on this steering wheel was, then you should be happy to know that both the elements were really good, they felt strong, responsive, and smooth.</p>
<p>So with so much to offer, is there anything this racing wheel can’t do? Well, in short, no. The steering wheel was able to handle everything thrown at it gracefully. You can go ahead and nitpick about the construction, but deducting points on that basis won’t be making any sense. With that out of the way, the TX Racing Wheel Ferrari 458 Italia Edition is definitely one of the best racing wheels available in the market, it offers a cool Ferrari branding and has enough to keep everyone satisfied.</p>

<h2>5. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L6AVN6S/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">HORI Racing Wheel One</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L6AVN6S/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-609 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/HORI-Racing-Wheel-One-Review.jpg" alt="HORI Racing Wheel One Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next up on the list is HORI Racing Wheel One, perhaps the best steering wheel for budget oriented people and you know what else is amazing about this one? It is actually officially certified by Microsoft to be used with the Xbox One. Now you can go show off your certified hardware to your friends. But is it actually worth the somewhat budget oriented $80 price tag? Let’s go ahead and find out.</p>
<p>The HORI Racing Wheel one comes with an all plastic construction, something that might be a letdown to some of the buyers, however, considering how it costs less than half of the likes of VG TX by Thrustmaster and G920 by Logitech, it’s fairly justified. Considering how the manufacturers wanted absolutely no bling in the HORI Racing Wheel, they ended up cutting down some of the features that make racing wheels so popular among the fans of racing games; for instance, this racing wheel doesn’t have any support for force feedback or vibration. This might be a deal breaker for people who plan on using this steering wheel with games like Forza Motorsport as it seems that it is better suited to people who’d be playing arcade racing games where the force feedback isn’t that necessary.</p>
<p>Despite being a solid offer for 80 bucks, there are some things about the HORI Racing Wheel One that you wouldn’t like; the exclusion of force feedback is a big no for a lot of gamers, and the only mounting system that is being offered by the steering wheel uses suction cups in order to have the unit stick on a surface. If you can overcome these shortcomings, then you would be pleased to know that HORI Racing Wheel is a great budget oriented steering wheel.</p>
<div class="su-button-center"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L6AVN6S/?tag=10beasts-20" class="su-button su-button-style-default affb" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#ff9900;border-color:#cc7a00;border-radius:50px;-moz-border-radius:50px;-webkit-border-radius:50px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:8px 24px;font-size:18px;line-height:27px;border-color:#ffb84d;border-radius:50px;-moz-border-radius:50px;-webkit-border-radius:50px;text-shadow:none;-moz-text-shadow:none;-webkit-text-shadow:none"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right" style="font-size:18px;color:#FFFFFF"></i> Buy HORI One now from Amazon</span></a></div>
<h2>6. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0151K6FPC/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Thrustmaster VG TX Racing Wheel</a> &#8211; Leather Edition</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0151K6FPC/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-608 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Thrustmaster-TXl-Ferrari-458-Review.jpg" alt="Thrustmaster TXl Ferrari 458 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The last one on the list is Thrustmaster VG TX Racing Wheel-Leather Edition, you might be wondering why we are reviewing something that has been reviewed earlier, but you should know that the one previously reviewed was the simple edition and this one happens to be the leather edition. If you are willing to go for something that is the premium in looks and equally amazing in performance, then the Thrustmaster VG TX is something that you should get. Basically, the steering wheel comes in two different variants, the one that has leather and the one without leather. Before we begin, we would like to point out that the VG TX is made as a direct competitor to the Logitech G920, however, unlike the competition, has support for PC as well as Xbox One, with that out of the way, let’s talk about how good Thrustmaster made this steering wheel.</p>
<p>Straight out of the box, you will be welcomed with premium quality leather that graces the wheel, and considering how the leather is one of the finest, the price gets justified. The steering wheel itself has all the necessary functions you need in order to play a racing game without any issues. One thing a lot of people complain about in a steering wheel is the lack in the amount of force feedback it offers, lucky for you, you will be welcomed by a force feedback that is strong and responsive as hell.</p>
<p>So is there anything lacking in the Thrustmaster VG TX? Nothing for a common consumer, however, if you are a hardcore enthusiast and like to nitpick on every single thing, then you might be annoyed by the fact that the pedals on this steering wheel can’t be inverted, and also the fact that the pedals are mostly made out of plastic, and are quite uncomfortable when you are using the pedals for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>In short, the Thrustmaster VG TX is perhaps one of the best steering wheels you can buy for your Xbox One, not only Xbox One, but it also has full support for PC and works well on all the racing games and even games that incorporate driving into them somehow. With that out of the way, the steering wheel offers solid construction and has more than enough to offer for a peripheral that comes at a reasonable price.</p>

<h2>Other Accessories &#8211; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ORLVWNM/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Openwheeler Cockpit</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ORLVWNM/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-604 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Openwheeler-Racing-Wheel-Review.jpg" alt="Openwheeler Racing Wheel Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next on our list isn’t exactly a racing wheel but a cockpit for steering wheels, we are taking a look at the Openwheeler Racing Wheel that is a complete cockpit that is designed for several different steering wheels including the famous G29 and G920 by Logitech as well as some other famous brands like Thrustmaster. The cockpit retails at around $400 but is it worth the price? Let’s find out in the review.</p>
<p>Several different reviews have acclaimed this chair to be one of the best ones that are currently available in the market and has also called it a “true racing seat” although the chair is available in several different colors, our review unit arrived in red black accents. Upon finally unboxing the chair, it was revealed that it is made out of the highest quality material and doesn’t compromise on the quality at all. The chair was comfortable to use by everyone we allowed to test the chair, and has a lot of adjustment options that will please everyone, it doesn’t matter if you are tall, big, heavy, or short, the chair will adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>At $400, the chair is way more than what you can get. It is made using top of the line material and has more options to keep everyone happy.</p>

<h2>Final Word &#8211; Wrapping it up</h2>
<p>As compared to the early days, the peripheral market is saturated by all the 3<sup>rd</sup> party manufacturers. Gone are the days where you would get peripherals only from OEMs like Microsoft and Sony. Nowadays, more and more 3<sup>rd</sup> party manufacturers are stepping in and bringing some really amazing stuff on the table. For instance, Logitech and Thrustmaster have been bringing some really amazing stuff on the table. If you are looking for PlayStation Steering wheel, you might want to look at here. <a href="http://heavy.com/games/2015/06/best-xbox-one-ps4-racing-wheels-gaming-games/">PS4 Steering Wheels</a></p>
<p>If you are in the market for a new steering wheel to quench your professional thirst for racing games, you will be welcomed with hundreds of choices, and in all honesty, it is very easy to get lost amongst the choices you have. That is why lists like this one exist, the reason is simple, the lists we make are there in order to help people make the most of the money they are about to spend, and contrary to popular belief, steering wheels for consoles are living on because of more and more amazing games that are coming out every year. Take Forza for instance; the game has been around for quite some time and the new installment is also coming somewhere this year.</p>
<p>We hope that the list was good enough for you to make a decision.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, this gave way to a lot of manufacturers like Asus, Logitech, Razer, Corsair, and a couple of other companies to step up their game and bring forth some of the best gaming peripherals in the market.</p>
<p>Considering how today, we will be discussing the best gaming mouse 2017, you should know that while the “gaming” and your standard mouse work on a similar fashion, and mechanism, gaming mice are better because they offer you to switch between different DPIs and extra programmable buttons. Imagine playing a Roleplaying game and having all your spells assigned to the buttons on your mouse along with the primary attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Sounds awesome, doesn’t it? Well, it has happened.</strong><br />

<p>Now that we have everything out of the way, let’s take a look at the topic of discussion we have on our hands, today, we will be looking at the best gaming mice that are available in the market for the consumer to buy.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering why this list is being made, well that’s because the market is saturated right now, and every other company is releasing a gaming peripheral including keyboards, headsets, and mice. While it may seem like a walk in the park for hardcore consumers, for people who don’t have a lot of knowledge about these gaming peripherals, things can somewhat difficult.</p>
<p>In order to make sure that doesn’t happen, we have come up with a list of best gaming mice that you can buy in the market. In order to keep things fair and stable, we have included both wirelesses as well as wired gaming mice to make sure that all the readers are thoroughly satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>So, without further ado, let’s take a look at the best gaming mice.</strong></p>
</div>
<h2>1. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZC3I6U/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow" name="one">Steel Series Rival 700</a> &#8211; The only mouse which Vibrates</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZC3I6U/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1277 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SteelSeries-Rival-700-Review.jpg" alt="SteelSeries Rival 700 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>The first gaming mouse on our list is the Steel Series Rival 700, and for those who don’t know, the company’s Rival series is perhaps one of the most popular series that is currently under Steel Series, as for Steel Series itself, the company is the favourite among pretty much every single professional e-sports gamer, and has earned itself a lot of reputation among the most passionate gamers there are.</p>
<p>Before we begin looking at just how good the Steel Series Rival 700, there are some obvious things you should know about this mouse; the Rival 700 is unique in a sense that it carries an OLED display that can display a variety of different things including settings, as well as some GIFs that are specifically made for this display and can be downloaded from several series.</p>
<p>Speaking of the technical details, the Rival 700 is a modular mouse that offers features such as a modular design, RGB lighting, OLED display, adjustable DPI settings with DPI maxing out 16,000 on the optical sensor, and 8,000 on the laser sensor, and yes, you can change the sensor by buying one separately. Sadly, though, as much as we would have wished, the mouse doesn’t come with an ambidextrous design and might be a problem for people who aren’t left-handed. However, that doesn’t mean that the Rival 700 isn’t a good mouse, behind the expensive price lies a really good mouse that fits gamers of all sorts, it doesn’t matter if you are playing an FPS, an <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/tag/en/RPG/#p=0&amp;tab=PopularNewReleases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPG</a>, an MMO, the mouse is there to serve, and serve you well.</p>
<p>Our only issue with the Rival 700 is that it should have been available for the left-hand users and that the modules that are sold separately should have had a more affordable price tag. With that said, we are going to take a look at both the pros and cons of the Steel Series Rival 700.</p>

<h2>2. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EMP3XDY/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow" name="two">Asus ROG Spatha</a> &#8211; Best MMO Gaming Mouse</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1278 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ROG-Spatha-Review.jpg" alt="Asus ROG Spatha Review" width="300" height="250" />Asus took everyone by surprise when they announced their flagship gaming mouse known as the Spatha, if you think the name sounds aggressive, take a look at the mouse itself.</p>
<p>The Spatha, of course, belongs to Asus’ top of the line Republic of Gamers line up, so you should know that you’d be getting a massive gaming mouse that would be filled with feature of all sorts, additional buttons, RGB effects that even sync up to your other ROG branded products such as motherboards, graphic cards, and even the keyboard by Asus.</p>
<p>Now before we start discussing the in-depth details, you should know that Spatha is more than just a gaming mouse, from the construction standpoint, it actually is a marvel, and while Asus’ choice of using magnesium alloy instead of the traditional materials that are used in the gaming mouse. This mouse can be considered quite heavy as opposed to the competition it has, and the price is something only for the hardcore gamers.</p>
<p>With said, if you are wondering about the technical details, you should know that the ROG Spatha comes with an awful lot of programmable buttons, and that’s not all, you also get a charging bad that looks stylish as hell. Now at this point, you may have guessed that the mouse is wireless, well, here’s a catch, you can use it wirelessly without any input lag, and you can use it with the wire as well. You get the RGB lights, and pretty much every other feature you’d expect from a flagship mouse. The mouse comes with 12 programmable buttons that can be programmed as per your needs using the Asus Armoury software, you also get 8,200 max DPI, amazing ergonomics and comfort for long gaming sessions, the main buttons use Omron switches that are rated for a really high click cycle, and even if they wear out, you can always replace them.</p>
<p>We won’t be saying that the ROG Spatha is the perfect gaming mouse, it does have some flaws like the buttons on the side feeling a bit too flimsy, but that doesn’t mean that it’s any less capable. So, without further ado, let’s go ahead and read some of the pros and cons of this mouse.</p>

<h2>3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EWEHI5K/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow" name="three">Razer Ouroboros</a> &#8211; Ambidextrous Gaming Mouse</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EWEHI5K/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-420 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Razer-Ouroboros-Review.jpg" alt="Razer Ouroboros Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next up on our list is the Razer Ouroboros, and in case you don’t know, Razer is perhaps one of the best peripheral company out in the market, that shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone because it’s simply too good.</p>
<p>This mouse can be called the direct competitor of Asus Spatha but has been around for quite some time. It is again, a wireless/wired combination, and unlike Spatha, it does offer an ambidextrous design making it a top pick for many users. One should keep in mind that the Ouroboros is strictly made for the enthusiasts, and it doesn’t offer features such as the RGB lighting, though considering how it’s a pretty old mouse, Razer may release an updated version with the Chroma lighting in near future.</p>
<p>The mouse we are reviewing today can be called the direct competitor of &#8220;Asus Spatha&#8221; but has been around for quite some time. It is again, a wireless/wired combination, and unlike Spatha, it does offer an ambidextrous design making it a top pick for many users. With that said, one should keep in mind that the Ouroboros is strictly made for the enthusiasts, and it doesn’t offer features such as the RGB lighting, though considering how it’s a pretty old mouse, Razer may release an updated version with the Chroma lighting in near future.</p>
<p>With that said, in case you are wondering about the good stuff that goes into this mouse, well, there is quite a lot. Razer has designed this mouse and kept modification in mind, most of the parts on the mouse can be removed and shifted around, and yes, you do get weight tuning, something most people love. Some of the adjustments include the ability to tune weight, as well as the palm rest in order to get the optimal gripping experience. The mouse also comes with 11 programmable buttons, as well as highly accurate dual sensors to keep everything in order.</p>
<p>There is no way that this mouse is perfect as there are some obvious flaws, for starters, the mouse is pricey considering how after all, it&#8217;s a gaming mouse. In addition to the price, for people who are looking for a simple experience, it can be a bit too confusing. However, don’t let that stop you from buying this otherwise amazing gaming mouse.</p>
<p>So, let’s not waste anymore time, and get right into the pros and the cons.</p>

<h2>4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CEFEMFW/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow" name="four">Logitech G900 Chaos Spectrum</a> &#8211; Best Wireless Mouse for Gaming</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CEFEMFW/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1279 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Logitech-G900-Chaos-Spectrum-Review.jpg" alt="Logitech G900 Chaos Spectrum Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>It shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone but there is no peripheral list that would be complete without the inclusion of a peripheral from Logitech.</p>
<p>Whether you are talking about keyboards, speakers, or headphones, Logitech has to be on the list simply because they are that good, and no, we aren’t just talking about the gaming peripherals from Logitech. We are talking about pretty much every single type of peripherals that the company has released in its long stay in the industry.</p>
<p>Similarly, a gaming mice list would have been incomplete without the inclusion of the Logitech G900 Chaos Spectrum; now before we begin, you should keep in mind that this mouse can actually be considered a direct rival of much revered Asus Spatha, and the Razer Ouroboros mainly because of the price as well as the amount of features you get, and that’s nowhere near a bad thing.</p>
<p>So, what’s good about the Chaos Spectrum? Well, there are a lot of things, for starters, you can go from 200 to 12,000 DPI on the fly, and that’s really impressive, do keep in mind that this isn’t just software increase, and the DPI is effectively changed across the board, you get the Spectrum lighting, something that is Logitech’s own version of RGB lighting, and you get the legendary software suite that Logitech is known and loved for. The Chaos Spectrum can be used wirelessly and wired, and just like the Ouroborus, does come with an ambidextrous design.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that this is a flagship mouse from Logitech, so if you are concerned about paying a high price, you are also getting some of the finest features, regardless of you needing them or not. With that said, if you are wondering about us encountering any downsides, there aren’t any deal breakers here. Sure, the mouse carries a hefty price tag, and the overall aesthetics of the ambidextrous design might put off some design conscious people, but under the hood, the Chaos Spectrum happens to be one of the MOST powerful, and over the top brilliant gaming mice we have used. So with that out of the way, pros and cons, shall we?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D63UU52/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1280 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Corsair-M65-Pro-RGB.jpg" alt="Corsair M65 Pro RGB Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>Corsair’s foray into the gaming peripheral industry managed to turn quite a lot of heads; mainly because everyone got excited that their favourite case, RAM, and power supply manufacturer is finally bringing in something different on the table, and believe it or not, the foray was a success.</p>
<p>Corsair didn’t just release a product range suited for every budget oriented, as well as well high-end gamers, but they made sure that all the products don’t share a drastic difference between the price they have and the features they give. That means that whether you are buying their mid-high range K70, or their enthusiast range K95, you won’t be sacrificing on the features a lot. That is something really good, and something a lot of other companies don’t follow.</p>
<p>With that said, we are taking a look at the Corsair M65 Pro RGB, one of the best gaming mice available in the market, and certainly made for users who are more inclined towards saving up some money, and still getting a lot in return.</p>
<p>The mouse, as the name suggest, does come with the RGB lighting that can be conveniently controlled through the Corsair’s customization software. The software itself is easy to use, although, it may require some learning curve, but that’s okay. You obviously get buttons to adjust the DPI to your liking, some customizable buttons, as well as a very, very handy weight tuning system that allows you remove some of the weights and put them away in order to make the mouse lighter. Now in case you are wondering, a lighter mouse means your hand will have an easier time gliding it, something a lot of FPS gamers are looking for.</p>
<p>Now essentially, the M65 Pro is definitely a mouse designed for FPS gamers, however, the good thing is that it is suitable to all the gamers regardless of the genre they are playing. So, definitely a plus point right there. With that said, let’s dive into what’s good, and what’s not about the Corsair M65.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IRHE892/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-385 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Logitech-G502-Review.jpg" alt="Logitech G502 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>We have another gaming mouse from Logitech, and this time, it’s the G502 Proteus Spectrum; to be fairly honest, it’s one of few mice by Logitech that helped the company establish itself.</p>
<p>If you are wondering, the Proteus Spectrum is just an updated version of the bestselling Logitech Proteus Core, the only difference is the inclusion of Spectrum lighting; Logitech’s version of RGB lighting. Where the G900 Chaos Spectrum is built for the enthusiasts who like to fire on all fours, the Proteus Spectrum is aimed at users who don’t want to spend an awful lot of money but still get the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>The Proteus Spectrum comes at a modest price, but for a modest price, you get a lot of features including DPI as high as 12,000 DPI</p>
<p>Speaking of the technical stuff, Logitech didn’t really change anything from the original Proteus Spectrum apart from the fact that they added the RGB lighting system that has pretty much become the industry standard and everyone is using it in their peripherals, be it a mouse, a keyboard, or a headset.</p>
<p>If we are to tell you about just how good the Proteus Spectrum is, there would be a lot of things to tell; for starters, the mouse costs half of what some of the flagship mice cost, apart from that, the mouse has an excellent value for money, 11 buttons that can be programmed however you want them to be, a comfortable design that doesn’t shy away from being stylish, and excellent tracking and response. So, without further ado, let’s take a look at the pros and the cons.</p>

<h2>7. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MYTSDU4/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow" name="seven">Razer DeathAdder Chroma</a> &#8211; Best Budget Mouse</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MYTSDU4/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-380 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Razer-DeathAdder-Chroma-Review.jpg" alt="Razer DeathAdder Chroma Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>Back when Razer originally released the DeathAdder, the mouse took the gaming industry by a storm, it quickly became one of the best gaming mice on the market, it actually didn’t cost a lot, and it was everything a gamer wanted.</p>
<p>The company later moved on released a few different mice as well, however, people still missed the DeathAdder, however, Razer finally decided to listen to the fans and came up with the Razer DeathAdder Chroma.</p>
<p>Now in case you don’t know, considering how the RGB lighting has become an industry standard, Razer has gone ahead and invented the Chroma lighting system that can be controlled through their brilliant Razer Synapse 2.0; now the Chroma system is perhaps one of the best RGB implementations we have seen in a long, long time.</p>
<p>With that said, everything about the Razer DeathAdder Chroma is new and improve, making it one of the most impressive gaming mice to step in the gaming industry; in case you are wondering what your money gets you basically get an amazing optical sensor that is capable of delivering an output of 10,000 DPI, and yes, you can control the DPI as per your liking, so even if you want to go lower, you can easily do so.</p>
<p>You also get Razer’s Synapse 2.0, one of the best customization suites you can find when it comes to the software. The good thing about Razer DeathAdder Chroma Is that the company followed the “if ain’t broke, don’t fix it” very gracefully, and didn’t bring any revolutionary changes apart from some hardware tweaks, and in our opinion, that’s the best way to do it. Simply put, people who find the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum too fancy, going for a Razer DeathAdder Chroma is the best choice there is. Let’s dive a little deeper into some pros and cons in order to give you a better idea.</p>

<h2>8. <a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B019OQJ9XE/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow" name="eight">Corsair Scimitar RGB</a> &#8211; Most Prgorammable Buttons</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B019OQJ9XE/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1284 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Corsair-SCIMITAR-Review.jpg" alt="Corsair SCIMITAR Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>Corsair decided to jump in the gaming market, and while some thought that it’s just a fad, and the company will move on, the actual plans were a bit different. The company released some of the best gaming peripherals back to back and managed to impress us with what they have in their arsenal.</p>
<p>With that said, while the M65 Pro was largely focused on the FPS gamers, the Corsair Scimitar is company’s attempt at making a great gaming mouse for the MOBA/MMO community. With that out of the way, the mouse comes with a total of 17 programmable buttons, 12 of which are conveniently sitting on a slider on the left side of the mouse, and are mechanical.</p>
<p>When we say slider, Corsair includes a hex screwdriver with the mouse that lets you adjust the slider as per your grip and the reach of your thumb. It’s nice to see Corsair paying attention to the detail. The mouse comes with one of the best sensors in the market, it uses an impressive Pixart ADNS 3988 sensor. The sensor supports a max DPI of 12,000, however, the DPI can be adjusted as per your need.</p>
<p>The mouse is built for users with large hands in mind, and all the buttons are conveniently placed, are responsive, and don’t feel mushy at all. Most of the construction is made using matte/glossy plastic, however, the middle of the mouse is aluminum, giving the mouse a good heft.</p>
<p>The mouse has 4 zone RGB lighting that can be controlled using the Corsair Utility Engine, the same software also works for customizing the mouse like programming the keys, assigning macros, and controlling the lighting.</p>
<p>As far as the performance goes, the Corsair Scimitar is capable of going head to head against the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum, both of the gaming mouse offer something unique, and are catered to different type of gamers, but under the core, they both have very identical performance as far as the sensor is concerned.</p>
<p>If you’re a gamer who doesn’t require a lot of macro keys, then the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum is the obvious choice, however, if you’re someone with a bigger hand, and someone who needs a lot of macro keys, then the Corsair Scimitar takes the win. With that out of the way, there’s no denying that both mice are exceptional.</p>

<p>The next on our list is the Razer Naga Hex V2, and before we begin, you should know that this is perhaps one of the more revered gaming mice among the MOBA games because of a number of buttons you get, and how you can customize them completely.</p>
<p>However, you should keep in mind that while this mouse is designed specifically for MOBA gamers, you should know that there is no way you can use in other games, however, this mouse is useable for games in which you have a lot of keyboard shortcuts, you can conveniently map them onto the mouse, and use them, thanks to amazing thumb grid.</p>
<p>Razer has gone on the record and stated that the Naga Hex V2 has mechanical switches in the thumb grid to ensure that gamers have the best possible experience, and the switches don’t end up wearing out. Our testing revealed a fair bit of a tactile feels in the thumb buttons, and it was certainly a welcomed addition.</p>
<p>The Naga Hex V2 comes with your traditional features that you can expect in a top of the line Razer mouse; you do get an excellent optical sensor capable of delivering a whopping 16,000 DPI. You also get the much revered Chroma RGB lighting that can be controlled and tweaked through the excellent Razer Synapse 2.0. Oh, yes, there’s more, you can even tweak all the present physical buttons on the mouse, and tailor them according to your own need, keeping in mind that all the buttons can be fully programmed. It’s certainly a big advantage for users who want to make sure they get the most out of this mouse. With that said, we are going to take a look at some of the benefits of the Razer Naga Hex V2, and why is it such a good gaming mouse for MOBA gamers.</p>
<p>Keeping it short, there are a lot of good things about the Razer Naga Hex V2, and there are a couple of bad things, but considering the industry standards, it has become a norm. With that out of the way, let’s take a look at the pros and cons.</p>

<p>The last product on our list is coming again from Corsair, and this time, it’s the Corsair Sabre RGB.</p>
<p>Before we begin, you should know that the Corsair Sabre RGB, in many ways, can be considered a younger brother of the Corsair M65 Pro RGB.</p>
<p>While a lot of people might be bummed out to know about the downgrade, you actually shouldn’t pay attention to it. The reason is simple, while the Sabre RGB is certainly the cheaper option, a lower price, and a different design gives it an identity of its own, and that is certainly a good thing because, at the given price point, you are getting a mouse that is able to have an impressive 10,000 DPI, a good design that will attract most gamers, and not mention, RGB lighting. So, in simple words, gamers are paying less and getting more when it comes to the Corsair Sabre RGB.</p>
<p>While the Sabre RGB won’t be winning any beauty pageants because of how simple it looks as compared to some other mice we have mentioned in our list, it is certainly a good thing because the mouse is designed with simplicity in mind and it does a great job at that.</p>
<p>The Sabre RGB can simply rest on your desk, and you won’t be bothered by it. No, we are not saying that the design is bad, it’s just stealthy, and that’s how most gamers prefer. You should keep in mind that you won’t be getting any weight tuning system but keeping the price as along with the weight of the mouse makes it clear that you don’t really need weight tuning. You get an excellent 10,000 DPI sensor and RGB lighting, and that should be more than enough.</p>
<p>Sure, as with many other gaming mice, and peripherals, there are good things, and then there are not so good things; same is the case with the Corsair Sabre RGB, and we are going to list down the pros and the cons below.</p>

<h3>Different Mouse for different Type of Gaming</h3>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-396 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Logitech-G502-Versatile-Gaming-Mouse.jpg" alt="Logitech G502 - Versatile Gaming Mouse" width="300" height="250" /></p>
<p>There are various big brands coming up new gaming mouse concepts and products every day.</p>
<p>The big names include Logitech, Razer, <a href="http://madcatz.com/products/mouse/">Mad Catz</a>, CM storm and more. Products from such brands make up the list of the best mouse for gamers 2017. While making your choice you would face the bittersweet problem of plenty,</p>
<p>It’s nice to have a wide variety to choose from, but it gets trickier too. Gamers got to know their choice in games before picking up their gaming mouse. Basically, games are categorized into three genres:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real Time Strategy (RTS)</li>
<li>Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO)</li>
<li>First Person Shooter (FPS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most gamers prefer one or two of those three game genres. Some might like to play every genre and pick up every game that hits the market. A gaming mouse like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IRHE892/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum</a> would do well for all type of games. Contrariwise Logitech G502 does extremely well at MMO games. For instance, you may never get enough of games like <a href="http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/">League of legends</a>, when you don’t have this mouse.</p>
<h3>Different Type of Mice Grips</h3>
<p>Aggressive grip stance results in attacking repertoire in PC gaming. Every gamer is more comfortable at one grip type over other. While choosing your gaming mouse, you must pick something that fits your favorite mouse grip. There are three types of grip stances, which are commonly preferred by gamers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Palm Grip:</strong> In this grip your hand entirely rests on the mouse. When you like to feel your palms rested, this is probably your favorite grip.</li>
<li><strong>Claw Grip:</strong> It is a ditto of palm grip with some tweaks. The index finger and middle finger is arched backward to make a perpendicular angle for clicking.</li>
<li><strong>Fingertip Grip:</strong> Only two fingers and thumb happens to touch mouse in this grip. Your hand stays in the air entirely.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Different Mice Concepts your must be aware of</h3>
<div class="su-accordion">
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Prediction</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">Gaming mice have to be smart to cater gamer’s every need. Modern mice are capable of avoiding registering erratic hand motions.  Mouse correcting isn’t always helpful since precision is largely compromised during gameplay. </div></div>
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Sensitivity</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">Mouse’s sensitivity is measured in DPI (Dots per inch) or CPI (characters per inch). DPI can be anywhere from few hundreds to few thousands. The higher the DPI, the faster can the mouse move on a screen. The sensitivity of any best gamer’s mouse 2017 has a wide range. </div></div>
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Sensor</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">There are two types of sensor in mice- optical and laser. The optical sensor is suited to even the roughest surfaces. Laser sensor, however, performs better on reflective surfaces. In such settings laser sensor, returns excellent DPI. </div></div>
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Acceleration</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">The ratio of pointer speed to the speed of hand movement defines the acceleration on a mouse. It’s measure in G force, where one G equals 9.8 meters per second. Low-sensitivity gamers need to come to terms with acceleration often since they require more hand movements. </div></div>
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Polling Rate</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">Polling rate refers to the transfer and response rate between mouse and computer. It’s measured in hertz and practically ranges between 250-1000Hz on any gaming mouse. Since the mouse is peripheral, the sent data is processed first before action is taken on screen. </div></div>
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Programmable Buttons</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">Programmable buttons makes gaming mice and keyboards more exciting. Gaming mice typically have buttons which can be turned into hotkeys for executing in-game actions a lot quicker. For instance, you can see sniper buttons present on an FPS specific mouse.</div></div>
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Profiles</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">With programmable buttons comes a set of profile settings. You can even specify different actions for buttons while changing characters in any game. With the same mouse, you can smoothly switch between genres and games.</div></div>
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Lift-Off Distance</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">Lift off distance is how high the mouse can be lifted up from the surface before move movements get unresponsive. Mouse software may come in handy to adjust lift-off distances. In competitive gaming, the lift-off distance plays a significant role.</div></div>
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Weight</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">Last but not the least, weight matters too. Not many gamers care much about it. But weight determines the level of feel during gameplay. Adjustable weights are a trending concept in gaming mice these days. Fine tuning it helps to make predictions easy and increases ease.</div></div>
</div>
<p>There is no denying that buying gaming mice have become sort of a necessity for a lot of people, some do it just to complete their gaming PC, while others do just for the sake of it.</p>
<p>However, there is one important thing a lot of gamers don’t know. Buying a gaming mouse doesn’t necessarily mean that your skills will improve by a drastic measure. Sure, a gaming mouse might help you in some ways, but if you are buying it just for the sake of improving your skills, then you are wrong. In case you don’t know, most professional, e-sports gamers are actually winning all the competitions without the use of a gaming mouse, and yes, it does come as a shock, but they have actually gone on the record and stated that they prefer a standard mouse better simply because they are used to it.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, that doesn’t mean that gaming mice are just gimmicky because they are not. Thanks to their high DPI, programmable buttons, customizable macros, and a lot of other features that are suitable for gamers. That’s why the market is so saturated with gaming mice, there are just too many options for the average gamer to choose from, and while it is certainly a good thing, it also makes a customer really, really confused.</p>
<p>Thankfully, to make things easier for the consumers, as well as for everyone who is reading this article, the choice of gaming mice should help them pick the one they want. That’s why we went ahead and used mice from every single price group, as well as gaming mice that were tailored to specific people or genre of games like the Razer Naga Hex V2 that is built specifically for the MOBA gamers.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this list should solve your gaming mice buying woes, and you will be able to buy the perfect gaming mouse that will complement your play style, as well as the type of grip you have.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So for a lot of people, this might come as a surprise, do you know that there is now a piece of technology known as a 3D pen?</p>
<p>Yes, that’s right, this new technology is quickly gaining popularity among artists or other people who are on the lookout to unleash their creativity using the 3D prints.</p>
<p>Before starting the list of Best 3d Pen 2017, I want you to know that what is this new technology?<br />
<a name="what3dpen"></a></p>
<h2>What exactly is a 3D pen?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-471 size-full" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3d-pens-1.jpg" alt="Best 3d Pens 2017" width="800" height="300" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3d-pens-1.jpg 800w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3d-pens-1-300x113.jpg 300w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3d-pens-1-768x288.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>A 3D pen is basically something that looks like a bulkier version of an ordinary pen or a pencil, however, instead of using the traditional lead or ink that is used in pencils or pen, the 3D printing pen operates using plastic. Yes, you’ve heard it.</p>
<p>Now it’s safe to say that there are a lot of questions roaming in your head about how difficult it is to use or is it even a good thing. Well, yes; first of all, using this pen is no different than using a normal pen or a pencil, you get to hold it the same way you hold the other aforementioned instruments, and yes, there are a lot of ways one can use a 3D pen.<br />
<a name="work"></a></p>
<h2>How does a 3d Printing Pen Work?</h2>
<div class="redb"><strong>Before we begin exploring more about 3D pens, let’s just clarify one thing; these instruments are nowhere associated with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?field-keywords=3d+printers&amp;tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">3D printers</a>.</strong></div>
<figure id="attachment_446" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017X3Y976/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-446 size-full" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3D-Pen-Filament-Refills.jpg" alt="3D Pen Filament Refills" width="300" height="250" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Plastic Filaments</figcaption></figure>
<p>A 3D pen basically uses plastic instead of ink, you insert the plastic filament at one, and once it’s inside the pen, it gets heated using some sort of heating technology inside, the heat is strong enough to melt the plastic, and turn it into a liquid, once that’s done, you can start using the pen to write on pretty much everything you want; the good thing about a 3D pen is that it works on almost all the surfaces.</p>
<p>If you are in awe, then don’t worry, we have seen similar technology like this known as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGeujbfgEI8">glue gun</a>, which works on almost the same principle as a 3D pen does. 3D pens basically come in several different colors in order to truly bring out the artist inside you.</p>
<p>If you are wondering what you can do with a 3D pen, the possibilities are limitless to be honest, where the drawings that you usually create using the ordinary pen and pencil are two dimensional, the 3D pens can add another dimension and make your drawings and artwork extra realistic. With that out of the way, even though these 3D pens are relatively new on the market, the market is quite saturated, this means that there are hundreds of choices, and if you are someone who is relatively inexperienced in this field, then you might have a really hard time finding the best 3D pen on the market.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.idevaffiliate.com/33268/101.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-1165 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3D-Simo-Review.jpg" alt="3D Simo Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>The 3D pen we have with us right now just maybe the most revolutionary 3D pen there is. You should know that the 3D Simo mini first appeared in a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/3dsimo-mini/3dsimo-mini-make-your-vision-come-true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kickstarter campaign</a> in order to get the project going, and while it seemed too ambitious and too innovative for its own good, the pen managed to get a lot of attention as well as financial backing.</p>
<p>Today, the 3D Simo Mini has finally become a reality, and people who are willing to try it out can do so by simply pre-ordering it. With that said, the company was nice enough to send us a review sample, and we finally unwrapped it to see what’s so special about the 3D pen, and in all honesty, we were blown away by the amount of top of the line features that have been put into the 3D Simo.</p>
<p>For starters, you should know that it’s not just a 3D pen, you see, the pen itself comes with a number of attachments that you can use in order to make it multi-purpose. In case you don’t know, the 3D Simo is 3D pen that can easily be turned into a soldering machine as well as a cutter, and something of a lighter. Yes, you’ve heard it. You get all these attachments supplied with the pen itself so you don’t have to go out and spend extra on these.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering, you can always take a look at the pen in action by simply watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QPZRBrAbpE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas Commercial Video</a>.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>Other than that, there are a lot of other things about the 3D Simo pen that a lot of people don’t know about, for starters, like we stated earlier, the attachments you get can basically be used for purposes of foam cutting, burning, as well as soldering.</p>
<p>You can use these attachments on a number of different materials such as wood, metal, as well as all the other materials that normally are supposed to work with the 3D pen. With that said, you don’t know the best thing about the 3D Simo pen, this pen comes with a feature that isn’t available in any other 3D pen in the market, so we can say that the 3D Simo managed to revolutionize the 3D pen industry. The 3D Simo comes with an iOS, Android, and Windows Phone app that you can use to control some of the basic functionalities of the 3D pen itself. In case you are wondering what can be, and cannot be controlled, you can choose profiles, along with some other options such as watching tutorial videos.</p>
</div>
<p>All the filaments were provided to us so we can do a proper evaluation of this amazing 3D pen. The filaments were PLA, ABS, as well as metal filaments. As for the attachments, they can be attached using the magnet.</p>

<h2>2. <a href="http://buy.lixpen.com?rfsn=300703.7731a" rel="nofollow" name="lix">Lix 3D Smart Pen</a> &#8211; Most Smallest and Smartest 3D Pen out there</h2>
<div class="redb"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Lot of consumers having hard time with this 3d pen but we had no issue at all while reviewing it. Anyhow, we are going to give it a try again to ensure that the pen is still the one, they send us for reviewing purposes. Till then, we don&#8217;t recommend you guys to buy this 3d pen.</div>
<p><a href="http://buy.lixpen.com?rfsn=300703.7731a" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-460" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Lix-3D-Printing-Pen.jpg" alt="Lix 3D Printing Pen Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>Lix took the world by surprise when the announced the world’s smallest 3D printing pen, as opposed to the first 3D printing pen as well as the others in the market, the Lix 3D printing pen proved to be a wonder for both the consumers and the critics alike. The pen tore through its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lix3d/lix-the-smallest-3d-printing-pen-in-the-world/description">Kickstarter campaign</a> and was finally available for the consumers to buy. We were lucky enough to get our hands on a review unit of this amazing 3D printing pen. Our impressions about this pocket-sized powerhouse? Let’s find out.</p>
<p>Like we stated earlier, the Lix 3D is perhaps the smallest 3D printing pen available in the market, but how does it perform? Well, you’d be surprised; the pen proved to be pretty much amazing in all the tests we have done. We conducted different tests including using this pen in a complete pin drop silent environment to test out if it has any of the issues that plague other 3D pens, to our surprise, this is perhaps one of the most quite 3D pens we have had the pleasure to use. With that said, the build quality of this 3D pen is really top notch, and it works brilliantly on almost all the surfaces we have tested on without any hiccups.</p>
<p>Another great thing about this 3D pen is that it is powered via a USB cable, this is really a big advantage considering how most of the 3D pen we have used required power through a power brick, which needed to be plugged into an outlet. However, you can use the Lix 3D printing pen without all that hassle, it can power up as long as it has a power source to power it up, you can even use a power bank to use it. Super simple.</p>
<p>If you are wondering whether or not this pen has any cons, then you’d be surprised to know that during our testing, we failed to find anything bad about this. The only thing we have to say about Lix 3D printing pen is how amazing it at the tasks it is supposed to handle. With that said, if you are in the market for a 3D printing pen that looks good and performs good, then you have a winner at your hand.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WFODEPC/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-459" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Scribbler-3D-Pen-V3-Review.jpg" alt="Scribbler 3D Pen V3 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The first on the list is the Scribbler V3, and as the name may suggest, it is an updated version of the legacy Scribbler Pen, this pen has been in the market for quite some time and is taking people by surprise. Perhaps one of the best features about this pen is the amazing build quality and perfect ergonomics that make this pen such a breeze to use. With that said, let’s find out some details about how good this pen is.</p>
<p>For starters, the pen comes in various different colors, but don’t worry, you can actually use filaments of different colors with the pen. As of now, the 3D pen is available in a total number of 8 colors, the available colors are Blue, Green, Purple, Red, White, and Yellow.</p>
<p>In our testing, it was revealed that the pen is extremely light weight and highly easy to operate, and if you are having concerns about how easy it is to change the filament, then don’t, the pen operates in a rather easy and friendly manner that allows you to operate it without any hassle.</p>
<p><strong>See, how you can be awesome with the Scribbler Pen</strong> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>To be very honest, the Scribbler 3D Pen V3 didn’t really have any major downsides to begin with, all the tests were passed with flying colours, however, for people who are used to the traditional way of drawing using a pen or a pencil might have some issues drawing with this pen at first because like all 3D pens, this one has a learning curve. Rest assured, this is without a shadow of a doubt, an amazing pen.</p>

<h2>4. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S4CJWVE/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">7TECH 3D Printing Pen</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S4CJWVE/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-461" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/7TECH-3D-Printing-Pen-Review.jpg" alt="7TECH 3D Printing Pen Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next up on our list is the 7TECH 3D Printing Pen. This specific 3D printing pen was designed with only one purpose in mind; the easy to use, user-friendly nature. With that said, the company behind this amazing 3D printing pen ensured us that the product will have an incredibly silent operating mode, in addition to that, the pen also comes with several features that make this 3D printing pen, one of the best we have seen. Let’s find out more about it.</p>
<p>The 7TECH 3D printing pen has some advanced features that are welcomed additions, for instance, this 3D printing pen comes with one of the best thermal control, in addition to that, the 3D printing pen also manages to notify you about the filament getting stuck. Last but not the least, in case you hate the super-fast or super-slow extrusion of many 3D pens, you don’t have to worry about this one as it actually lets you control the extrusion according to your own preferred speed.</p>
<p>The only 2 issues we actually encountered during our review and testing were the lack of supplied filaments as well as how hot the pen can get while it’s fully operational. Do keep in mind that while you are operating the pen, the temperature can go incredibly high, and to an extent that it may cause damage to your skin if you get In contact with it. With that said, we also realized that the supplied filament wasn&#8217;t enough, but then again, companies through these in for the royalty. With that said, the 7TECH 3D Printing Pen is one of the finest 3D printing pens we have used and is certainly one of the top 3D pens.</p>

<h2>5. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B016QGM5Q8/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ccbetter Intelligent Pen</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B016QGM5Q8/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-462" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ccbetter-Intelligent.jpg" alt="ccbetter Intelligent 3d pen Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The fourth on our list is the ccbetter Intelligent 3D Pen before we go into details, you should know that this pen is also sold under a different name that is called Joyluxy Intelligent 3D. With that said, the Intelligent 3D pen is one of the best 3D pens 2017 we have had the pleasure of reviewing. Speaking of functions and features, the 3D pen is quite basic and has all the necessities anyone would want in a 3D pen. With that out of the question, let’s take a closer, and proper look at the CCbetter Intelligent 3D pen from Joyluxy.</p>
<p>The pen comes in a sleek-looking box that is no bigger than your usual smartphone box, inside the box, you find the usual power brick along with the 2 supplied filaments. Do keep in mind that you can always purchase separate filaments of your own choice, the manufacturer was nice enough to include a stand that you can use to put your pen on when it is not in use. The 3D printing pen was rather easy to use for both the newcomers as well as veteran artists, the testing revealed that it managed to work on almost all the major materials with great ease and consistently gave us brilliant results. The pen also comes with an OLED that has a small status indicator that tells you when the filament is heated and ready to use, quite a nice tough to be honest.</p>
<p>Speaking of cons, the thorough and concise testing didn’t really reveal any issues to begin with, however, we would have liked a bit more detailed instruction guide, especially for people who are reluctant when it comes to using such stuff without the proper guide to help them out. Apart from that, the pen managed to perform excellently in all the tests.</p>
<p>With that said, the CCBetter Intelligent 3D Pen from Joyluxy is probably one of our most favourite 3D pens we have used, and is a definite recommendation for someone who’s looking for the best bang for the buck.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L8IBQGA/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-463" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Lay3r-3D-Pen-Review.jpg" alt="Lay3r 3D Pen Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>We are halfway through the list, and the next product on our list is the Lay3r 3D pen. Before you say anything about the name, try and think about the saying that goes like “do not judge a book by its cover”, with that said, the Lay3r 3D pen took us be surprised as we weren’t expecting something so amazing. How is it amazing? Well, there’s only one way to find out. Let’s see.</p>
<p>As compared to the other 3D printing pens we have used and reviewed, the Lay3r 3D pen is oddly large, however, as big as it may seem, the 3D pen proved to be extremely good at handling and not heavy at all.</p>
<p>Another great advantage of the Lay3r 3D pen is that it is really easy to use. How easy, you ask? With proper guidance, a 12-year-old can use the pen without making any mistakes. However, the great thing about it is that it doesn’t matter if a kid is using this amazing pen or some veteran artist is, the pen is extremely easy to handle for people of all age and skill level.</p>
<p>We were surprised to see that the company has included a fan inside the pen to make sure it stays cool during the hot operating temperature, last but not the least, the pen comes with an automatic shutdown feature that turns off the pen when it’s not being operated.</p>
<p>As for the downsides, the only downside we actually think exists is the size of the pen, but then again, considering how it has a fan built inside of it, the size can be justified.</p>

<h2>7. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01A524ZKI/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GENESIS 3D Printing Pen Review</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01A524ZKI/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-465" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Genesis-3d-Printing-Pen.jpg" alt="genesis 3d printing pen review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next product on our list is the GENESIS 3D Pen, for those who don’t know, the company is also known for creating a really popular 3D printer. The company behind Genesis 3D pen is known as Lasso Labs and today we are bringing you this brilliant 3D pen. Let’s see how it manages to fair against the tough competition that is currently existing because of the saturated market of 3D printing pens.</p>
<p>The Genesis 3D pen is nicely designed and looks quite sophisticated, it’s nowhere near as slim and small as the Lix 3D printing pen but when it comes to doing the job, it isn’t any less than the competition. Our review unit came in all black, however, there are a few other color combinations available. The pen managed to perform eloquently in all the tests; it was smooth, the plastic filament didn’t get stuck, and the pen’s chassis didn’t get abnormally hot – something that is common with a lot of 3D pens. Lasso Labs was also kind enough to add in 5 filaments in the box, and you can always purchase the filaments separately. With that said, the Genesis 3D pen pleased us with the consistent performance and a minimal learning curve.</p>
<p>Moving on to the complaints, we don’t really have any. The only 3D pen managed to perform perfectly fine in almost all the situations and didn’t disappoint us at all.</p>

<p>The next one in the list is 3Doodler 3D printing pen. This stylish pen comes with 50, yes, you have heard it, 50 plastic filaments &#8212; the most number of filaments we have received with a 3D printing pen. The overall looks and feels of the pen are amazing, and the color (black) we received for reviewing made the pen look like something that came out from a Tom Clancy novel. With that said, let’s see if the pen is worth the $110 price tag. However, before we begin, you should know this pen is in no way related to another product that goes by the same name and is also known as the first 3D printing pen in the world.</p>
<p>This is perhaps one of the best-looking 3D printing pens available in the market, right next to the Lix 3D printing pen we have reviewed earlier, the greatest thing about this pen is that it comes with 50 filaments, and they are extremely easy to replace and do not get clogged. The testing phase revealed that the pen manages to work perfectly fine on almost all the surfaces. The pen happens to be really easy to use, especially for the veteran artists who have good experience with drawing and using such tools, as for newcomers, there is a slight learning curve for them.</p>
<p>In all honesty, we didn’t find any cons at all. There were some concerns, but pointing them out would be nitpicking as almost all the 3D pens we have reviewed had them with the exception of Lix 3D printing pen.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AORN41K/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-467" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Glyby-Intelligent.jpg" alt="Glyby Intelligent 3d Pen Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>Our next entry is the Glyby Intelligent 3D printing pen. Reviewers and users have hailed it as one of the best 3D printing pens ever available, and sure, it is nowhere near good looking as the Lix 3D printing pen, but in terms of functionality, the pen manages to perform quite well. How well, you ask? Well, let’s find out, shall we?</p>
<p>The Glyby Intelligent 3D printing pen is perhaps the cheapest 3D printing pen available in the market, it retails for just $50 and in terms of performance, it manages to give a groundbreaking performance and works on almost all the surfaces. With that said, do keep in mind that this 3D printing pen is made with kids in mind, so if you want something for some extra professional work, you probably might want to spend your money somewhere else, and on something more expensive that would be more appropriate for the professional work. Moving on, the pen is easy to use for kids, it has enough features to keep them happy for a long time, and as long as they operate under a proper supervision, things won’t go wrong.</p>
<p>At the given price, there isn’t anything to complain about the Glyby Intelligent 3D printing pen, the main purpose of this 3D printing pen is to make sure that the children can developer their minds properly, and it does a great job at that. Sure there are better 3D printing pens available in the market, but do keep in mind that they are usually above $90. With that said, the Glyby 3D printing pen is an amazing gift for kids who are always up for learning new, interesting and soulful things.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B017I1GP3Y/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-468" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CreoPop-3D-Cordless-Printing-Pen.jpg" alt="creopop 3d cordless printing pen review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>We are bringing something extraordinary for you, just like the Lix 3D printing pen, the CreoPop 3D cordless printing pen is a revolution on its own. What’s good about it? It doesn&#8217;t require a wire to work, which means that there is an insane amount of portability that comes with this 3D printing pen, and if you want more cool things from this pen then here’s another surprise; unlike the rest of the 3D printing pens, this one doesn’t have any heating parts. Yes, you have heard it, this pen uses plastic without even heating and melting it.</p>
<p>As compared to the other pens that use thermoplastics, the CreoPop uses photopolymers, this is the type of ink that starts liquefying as soon as it is exposed to LED diodes. With that said, let’s find out more about the pen itself. Considering how there is no heated, melting plastic involved, the pen is extremely easy to use and completely safe for children as there won’t be accidental burns. The testing revealed that despite a completely different ink, pen managed to perform excellently in almost all the tests despite having a completely different type of ink.</p>
<p>Coming to the cons, or things we didn’t like about the pen, to be honest, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. If you want something that is futuristic, easy to use, and fancy, then you should definitely get this one. The only concern we have is that currently, the ink is supplied only by one company, and that might be a problem for some people as other pens can pretty much use any plastic filament available in the market. With that out of the way, the CreoPop 3D Cordless Printing Pen is amazing and one of a kind that will make any art lover happy.</p>

<h2><a name="buyerg"></a>3d Pen Buyer&#8217;s Guide</h2>
<p>Before buying a 3D pen, you must familiarize with its functioning and applications. The modus operandi is different with each brand. Between filament and design, there can be tons of variables. Newest 3D pen products may not share the same design as the world’s first 3Doodler model. 3Doodler for instance, uses plastic filament, thus making it easy to draw in the air. Real-time creation of 3D objects in serious pace was a real prospect. 3D pens don’t have a long history.</p>
<p>The very first project of its kind was funded as a kick starter product.  So, you wouldn’t have too many variables to know about, in order to master 3D pen technology. The success of 3Doodler inspired another gem of a product in Scribbler. With productions in China, Scribbler was still able to deliver with 6-month warranty plus return policy. Some unattended promises such as Lix tiny 3D pen still work under progress for years now. If you don’t know how to go about choosing your 3D pen, this can be trickiest of markets.</p>
<p>3D technology takes large steps as we speak. Nevertheless, there isn’t too much to learn about, in comparison to typical household electronics. Getting a grasp of this technology can be real easy. Evolution of this technology can be explained quickly by comparing plastic and cool ink pens.</p>
<h3>3D plastic pen vs. Cool Ink pen</h3>
<p>3Doodler and Scribbler accounted for most products of 3D printing pens in the initial stage of 3D pens market. All of them used plastic for drawing 3D objects in the air. The successive development took place in the form of cool ink pens. They made drawing in 3D as possible as it was in the case of plastic pens. The added advantage to it was the riddance of hot parts. Without hot components, it was a safer option for all age groups, especially kids. Since September 2015, cool ink pen models were released and competed for market share.</p>
<p>First, few cool ink pens such as the 3D Creation Maker didn’t provide users with an option of drawing in air. The drawing happens on a horizontal surface and the art is hardened later. It didn’t match the feel of drawing in the air. During November last year, products like CreoPop came up with a solution. They put UV to use, thereby making drawing in the air possible. The plastic pens vs. cool ink pens sum up the evolution of 3D printing pens.</p>
<h3>Additional Features</h3>
<p>The first and foremost function of 3D pens are to draw 3D art or objects. The functioning and design would facilitate filament loading, filament conversion and draw process. Additionally, some extra features can come to rescue, when needed the most. Standby mode would be a classic example of the useful additional feature. Large LCD screens can give a product an edge over competitors. Some products even have filament jamming detection system. Smart 3D pens come with extreme options like thermal management, working LED etc..</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type of control</strong>: Quality of 3D pen can be boosted with the extra bit of control it gives the user. For instance, the temperature can be controlled in plastic 3D pens. You can also control the speed of drawing in few products. The adjustable feed can help regulate flow and speed of drawing. Continuous speed regulation elevates your comfort and ease of drawing. Adjustable temperature can help fine tune your drawings to levels you didn’t know existed. It changes the entire 3D art experience. Intelligent controls are what the new millennium product needs, to create massive appeal.</li>
<li><strong>Design</strong>: Ergonomic design is the need of the hour when it comes to 3D pens of now. Many promises haven’t been delivered, including the tiny 3D pen from Lix. Slimmer 3D pens are what that’s preferred in current market scenario. Best products are super small and can be recharged even through laptop USB. Design plays a huge role in how easy controls feel on your hand.  The design should allow easy access to display. Your view should flow seamlessly from filament to dropping ink or plastic. Light weight and ergonomic design would enhance the quality of 3D pen any day.</li>
<li><strong>Filament type</strong>: Type of filament would have a say in your drawing style. It determines how you hold the pen and which grip you would be getting. Filament contains the plastic element, which enables drawing. At this point in time, there are more than a dozen different filament types available in the market. As a rule of thumb, the easier it is to replace, the better it is for use. Easily replaceable filament type helps a great deal in the long run. It makes your 3D pen usable for a long time. There are 4 major categories in filaments – Standard, Flexible, Composite, and Specialty.</li>
<li><strong>Brand name</strong>: Brand name definitely matters in this young technology. 3Doodler invented the world’s first 3D printing pen. Scribbler offers the luxury of 6-month warranty. The catch would its production model based in China. Brands like Lix are proven to be innovative. Every brand makes users come up with few realistic expectations. Compare brands and models on the basis of quality and features available. False marketing is what you would commonly see in this category of products. It would be your responsibility to examine the brand and know what to expect.</li>
<li><strong>Check Reviews</strong>: Word of mouth wouldn’t work for 3D pens on reputation or marketing front. Every 3D printing pen artists would be first generation users. You got to trust internet reviews and marketing claims. Read customer reviews across different and shopping site. Beware of fabricated reviews and spot them when things look too good to be true. It is the easiest way to determine quality and worth of your product. Reviews would be the first-hand information you need before deciding if the product would work or not. A lot of 3D printing pen models made promises which were never delivered. Dig more for video reviews on YouTube. This way, you can see for yourself, how these pens work.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion &#8211; Wrapping it up</h2>
<p>Right now, buying a 3D printer is a simple equivalent of spending an awful lot of money. Yes, a 3D printer makes sense if you have to undertake large projects that are simply not possible on a 3D printing pen.</p>
<p>However, if you want a 3D printing pen for doing a small exhibition or school projects than it is more than an adequate choice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the market is relatively new, but the choices are quite a lot, that’s why this list was made. In order to assist interested consumers in picking the best possible 3D printing pen.</p>

<p><strong>Protective Case</strong> &#8211; The first accessory I always buy when I upgrade my iPhone is a new protective case. I think protective cases are the best iPhone accessories because they save you hundreds of dollars almost every time you drop your device.</p>
<p>I always choose a slim fit case. It&#8217;s very cheap, looks good on the iPhone design and most important protect your device from drops.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth Headphones</strong> &#8211; The second accessory you should have with your iPhone are a pair of Bluetooth headphones.</p>
<p>If you are a tech geek, then you should know that Bluetooth headphones are the future. Wired headphones are quickly going out of the market, especially with the Apple&#8217;s new iPhone 7 device.</p>
<p>I use Wireless Beats by Dre headphones, and I love them. They sound good, are very stylish and quick to setup.</p>
<p><strong>Portable Charger</strong> &#8211; I use my iPhone a lot, and by a lot, I mean about 6 hours screen time. With such heavy usage, the battery runs out very quickly. That&#8217;s why I always hold a portable battery charger on my backpack. It is a must-have accessory, and they are very cheap.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to go for a 10,000 mAh external battery, but a 3,000 mAh capacity external charger can charge your iPhone battery twice so that It would be enough for an average user.</p>

<p>First I would say it&#8217;s going to depend on what you use your phone for most. However, 3 of the best general accessories I can think of that would apply to most people are a tempered glass screen protector, an external flash drive with lightning and a battery pack.</p>
<p><strong>Tempered glass screen protector</strong> &#8211; It is probably my favorite thing ever. It&#8217;s like a bulletproof vest for your screen. I can&#8217;t say how many times those have saved hundreds in repairs and there&#8217;s virtually no downside. I now put a tempered glass screen protector on every repair I do, and people love them.</p>
<p><strong>Flash Drive</strong> &#8211; It may not fit everybody&#8217;s needs, but if you got the 16GB phone (which winds up being more like 11GB), or use a lot of storage, it&#8217;s a must. I use mine daily to be able to keep files off my phone, and it makes transferring data that much easier as I don&#8217;t need to have a lightning cable to move data at work.</p>
<p><strong>Battery Pack</strong> &#8211; These things have saved my ass more than a few times. I have a 24000MAh battery pack, and it will charge my phone dead to full about six times. These are especially necessary if you&#8217;re one of the unlucky 6S owners whose phone dies at 35% after the 10.1 update. Regardless, though, I never leave home without mine.</p>

<p><strong>A case</strong> &#8211; Protect your phone. iPhones are at least $500, so spend $10 and get a good case.</p>
<p><strong>Apple AirPods</strong> &#8211; Truly wireless earbuds. No wires and excellent battery life. The future is wireless, so embrace it now.</p>
<p><strong>A car charger</strong> &#8211; Keep a good one handy in your car to get a little extra juice on the ride in or home from work.</p>
<p>Nothing is more frustrating than needing to charge your phone and having to wait until you get home. It could also be a safety concern if something happened.</p>

<p>As iPhones have evolved so have their accessories; but unlike the smartphone behemoth, accessory manufacturers don’t have as much dominance in the market.</p>
<p>This is because it’s so competitive and diluted with similar gadgets and gizmos that do the same thing. So to help you decide which accessories are worth purchasing and which are worth avoiding, here are my top 3 favorite iPhone accessories on the market today.</p>
<p><strong>Belkin Lightning Audio + Charge RockStar</strong> &#8211; If you’ve got an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, you’ll understand the hardship of not having a headphone jack anymore. This simple but crucial adapter enables the latest iPhone users to charge their device while listening to headphones without having to purchase Apple’s wireless AirPods.</p>
<p><strong>Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector</strong> &#8211; People hate using screen protectors because they make their smartphone&#8217;s display feel cheap and ugly. That being said, I’ve been using this particular tempered glass screen protector on my iPhone 6 Plus since buying the phone in 2014, and it’s as good as new.</p>
<p>Because of the glass texture and clarity of the screen protector, I forget I’m even using this accessory! If you want your device to look good and avoid scratches, this product is a must.</p>
<p><strong>Bose QuietComfort 35 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones</strong> &#8211; If you have an iPhone 7, you’re going to want a pair of decent wireless headphones, right? These are quite simply the pinnacle of noise canceling headphones.</p>
<p>Their sleek design, luxury comfort ear cups, long battery life and outstanding sound quality all join to create a near perfect accessory. They come at a price, but doesn’t everything that’s best in class?</p>

<p><strong>My OtterBox case</strong> is my #1 go-to for cases. It can take a beating and protects my phone from everyday wear and tear.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also a big fan of <strong>Incipio&#8217;s charging cables.</strong> They have 2-meter-long ones that are perfect for when you need to be a little mobile while still charging.</p>
<p>That being said, I also love <strong>Eton&#8217;s Boost Turbine Charger.</strong> Not only can you plug your phone into this and charge it, but it has a crank that lets you manually charge up your charger when it runs low.</p>

<p><strong>iPad earphones</strong> &#8211; I am amazed by the sound quality. These earphones are my best partner when I want to cut off from the world and sail in the sea of sound. The complexity cancels the external noise which helps me listen to every beat of the songs.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone leather case</strong> &#8211; although there are many designs available, I prefer the traditional black leather case which makes my phone look sleek and stylish.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone screen protector</strong> &#8211; when it comes to durability and longevity if screen guard I trust only iPhone flagship products. My phone had been manhandled and has been dropped many times but thanks to the iPhone screen protector my screen is safe and crystal clear</p>

<p>My top 3 recommended iPhone accessories are:</p>
<p><strong>Olloclip Active Lens Set</strong> &#8211; By far this is the best attachment lens right now providing both wide and 2x telephoto. The lens set greatly extends the reach of your iPhone lens, especially if you have the dual lens of the 7 plus.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Watch 2</strong> &#8211; The iPhone and the Apple Watch 2 are like peanut butter and jelly, apple and pie, zig to the zag! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> They work together absolutely seamlessly.</p>
<p><strong>Mophie external battery charger</strong> &#8211; There is nothing worse than a dead iPhone. I’ve not only revived my own iPhone but my friends’ phones.</p>

<p>iPhone is undoubtedly an excellent device, but it has some restrictions on use. This is why, most people don&#8217;t mind preferring a low-end Android phone, for the convenience it offers. One of the biggest problems that iPhone users go through is the low storage issue.</p>
<p>Until you have the 128GB variant, you will require a big chunk storage to keep your data that include songs, videos, and photos. However, at such circumstances, one simple, small and portable Flash Drive can be your best recourse.</p>
<p>If you are in need of Flash Drive, we would greatly recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CIEBU22/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Sandisk SanDisk USB 3.0 Flash Drive</a> without thinking twice. This flash drive takes care of all your videos and photos, and you can use it &#8211; anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>Music is a dope for some, and the ultimate savior for some. Almost everyone has a strong feeling for good music and loves to listen to wonderful melodies. However, most of the times, he/she feels that the conventional long wires for music are way too messy.</p>
<p>Therefore, wireless music is the best way to enjoy music hassle-free. Trust <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013HSW4SM/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Jaybird X2</a> headphones for an incredible wireless experience.</p>
<p>The charging cable, with most of the Apple devices, is a sore aspect. Most of the times, they get easily damaged and aren&#8217;t long enough to reach your bed. Here are <a href="http://www.nativeunion.com/products/cables/?17">some cables</a> made by the Native Union, which are highly durable and long enough to stay in reach.</p>

<p>There are seemingly endless choices for iPhone accessories out there, and I’ve got to tell you, I go through iPhone accessories like candy. One day I like something I’m using, and another day I find it to be a nuisance, and I end up leaving it at home and buying something completely different to suit my needs.</p>
<p>Regardless, there are still some accessories that I still use on a day-to-day basis, and in this piece, I’ll show you my top 5 favorite iPhone accessories that I use on a daily basis and why.</p>
<p>Before getting started, one thing I’d like to note before I start is that these are my five favorite iPhone accessories that I use on a daily basis. I’m not trying to push them on anyone because I know everyone’s opinion is going to vary and not everyone is going to agree with my choices.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I do hope that in posting this it’ll help some people with accessory discovery. My daily driver is an iPhone 6 Plus, which is the previous-generation 5.5-inch iPhone.</p>
<p>Some of these accessories are also compatible with other iPhones out of the box, but some of them are available in different versions that are made specifically for all the different shapes and sizes of iPhones on the market today.</p>
<p>Having said that, let’s get into it, shall we?</p>
<div class="su-tabs su-tabs-style-default my-custom-tabs" data-active="1"><div class="su-tabs-nav"><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Otterbox Alpha Glass Privacy</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Speck Candyshell Grip</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Plantronics M70 Bluetooth Headset</span></div><div class="su-tabs-panes"><div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>Probably one of my favorite and most-used accessories is the Alpha Glass Privacy screen protector from OtterBox.</p>
<p>It’s a tempered glass screen protector, which means it looks and feels like the factory glass screen on the iPhone. It doesn&#8217;t reduce the screen’s sensitivity capacities and also comes with the added benefit of blocking out the display at stark viewing angles. This way peering eyes around you can’t see what you’re doing on your iPhone – only you can.</p>
<p>The screen protector is also still a fully-functional, multi-layer screen protector that helps in keeping your main glass display from scratching and shattering.</p>
<p>It hugs the Home button and front-facing camera/speaker/sensors very well without being too tight and just feels like an overall good and natural fit.</p>
<p>One of the things I like about it is that it seems to work with almost every case I’ve ever tried with my iPhone, apart from the ones that come with built-in screen protectors.</p>
<p>This gives you the flexibility of changing cases every so often, and still keeping the benefits of the privacy glass whenever you want to.</p>
<p>A word of warning – although OtterBox doesn’t list this screen protector as compatible with the iPhone 6s Plus, I want to confirm with everyone, just as I have with OtterBox, that it will work just fine with the iPhone 6s Plus.</p>
<p>The reason it’s not listed as compatible is because it may interfere with the front-facing flash Apple coded into iOS 9, but 3D Touch and everything else works as expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>I’ve tried a lot of cases for my iPhone – believe me – and one of the best I’ve found so far in terms of not only protection but also how the case feels in my hand and how responsive the buttons are is the Speck Candyshell Grip.</p>
<p>I work on cars a lot, and this means getting dirty and using my iPhone’s rear-facing LED flash a lot to see things in dark places. I’ve tried lots of protective cases, and this one is just right regarding protection and size.</p>
<p>It’s not too thick, but it has a strong protective feel to it. I’ve dropped my iPhone in my engine compartment plenty of times, and you’d never know because the case has kept my iPhone protected each and every time.</p>
<p>The volume and power buttons have a very crisp ‘click’ through the protective rubber button boots on the sides of the case, which I can’t say for all cases that I’ve tried.</p>
<p>The responsiveness of the buttons feels almost like there’s no case on my iPhone at all, and the click you feel is still very much audible through the case.</p>
<p>One of the useful features of this case is the rubber grips that go all across the back of the case.</p>
<p>When you’re using your iPhone one-handed and always feel like you’re going to drop it while texting someone, especially the case with today’s larger iPhones, those grips help you keep the iPhone in your hand without worrying about having butter fingers.</p>
<p>The cut-outs for the ports are also big enough to fit all my third-party headphones, speakers, Lightning connectors, and other goodies, so I have no complaints in that department either. Engineering did a great job making this case and I’d recommend it to (almost) anyone.</p>

<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>I do so much driving that it’s just not physically possible for me to constantly hold my iPhone up to my ear all day long. The Plantronics M70 Bluetooth headset has been my daily answer to that problem and it is a wonderful and affordable Bluetooth headset that works great with the iPhone.</p>
<p>The Plantronics M70 Bluetooth headset has been my daily solution to that problem, and it is a fantastic and affordable Bluetooth headset that works great with the iPhone.</p>
<p>Once being paired with the iPhone, the device’s battery level shows in the iPhone’s Status Bar, as well as in Notification Center under the Battery widget. The headset also supports invoking Siri by holding down on the button on the side for a couple of seconds, which I find super helpful throughout the day considering my iPhone’s internal microphones are dead because of water damage.</p>

<p>This headset is easy to hear even in noisy environments, and the easy volume adjustments mean you can adjust for both noisy and quiet environments with ease. It also works great for listening to music; it’s not just for answering calls. If I feel like jamming to some music while I drive, or while I walk, it’s an excellent tool to have</p>
<p>If I feel like jamming to some music while I drive, or while I walk, it’s a nice tool to have in that respect as well.</p>
<p>Regarding battery life, I can get an easy 11 hours of usage out of this headset before it has to be charged again, and it takes under 2 hours to fully charge it, which to me is like no time at all. It’s charged with a Micro-USB type of cable that plugs into a USB port on your computer or an AC adapter for your outlet in your wall.</p>
<p>In terms of comfort, I think this is one of the more comfortable options out there, but just like anything else you wear on your ears, you may want to take it off after a while. Nonetheless, it’s so lightweight you sometimes forget it’s even there.</p>

<p>When it comes to iPhone accessories, I always recommend these three products which I am personally using myself.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019ZVL418/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Jorno Ultra-Thin Folding Mobile Keyboard</a> &#8211; It is a lightweight keyboard specially designed for the iPhones which could also be used for the laptops and other devices. For just a few bucks, this handy, compact, good looking keyboard is an excellent choice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DF1N54S/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">HooToo Flash Drive</a> &#8211; Most of the iPhone users run out of storage. This device which comes with a Lightning connector at one end and USB 3.0 on the other is something more than just a storage device. It can simultaneously connect to iPhone and your laptop making it possible to manage your files better. I am personally using it, and yes, it is good.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0176HQ1O8/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Aukey 20,000 mAh Portable Charger</a> &#8211; Only few power banks come with the Lightning connector, and this is one of them. This extremely powerful battery pack can surely recharge your iPhone several times. The charging time is also way better than other devices we tested. It is also coming with Two full USB ports which allow charging extra devices if necessary.</p>
<p>So, these are our top 3 picks as the best iPhone accessories you should give a try.</p>

<p><strong>Audio Technica DSR7BT</strong> &#8211; A wireless Bluetooth headphone with a new technology known as the Pure Digital Drive system. Typically, headphones can only receive an analog signal to be outputted through the headphone drivers. What makes the DSR7BT different is that it is entirely digital.</p>
<p>With the AudioTechnica Pure Digital Drive system, audio can be played through the headphones without ever needing to be put into analog signals before output. In short, this means there is zero signal loss, and thus zero musical quality loss between your mp3 player and the headphones.</p>
<p><b>Znaps Magnetic Lightning Cable</b> &#8211; This lightning cable is completely waterproof and turns your iPhone lightning port into a MagSafe one typically used in Macbooks. This means that your phone won&#8217;t be yanked into the ground if you accidently step on a cable or bump into someone while holding your phone wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Moshi iVisor Screen Protector</strong> &#8211; This is different from most screen protectors it&#8217;s an entire solid screen protector instead of just a film. The company guarantees that it will be bubble free. It can resist everything from hammers to knives.</p>

<p>Here are my top iPhone accessories:</p>
<p>1. Moment Wide Lens.</p>
<p>These lenses take superb pictures and are perfect for landscape shots. The build quality is by far the best I&#8217;ve seen, they look great and is the only lens I&#8217;m happy to use when I don&#8217;t have my DSLR on me. I also love the way it mounts onto the iPhone, by attaching the mounting plate and then rotating the lens on feels so much more like a DSLR than any other clip-on lens.</p>
<p>2. TuneBand Sports Armband.</p>
<p>Perfect when I&#8217;m running or during a gym session. They&#8217;re comfortable. There’s no moving or flapping about; the iPhone just stays there. I know I can focus on my workout without having to worry about my iPhone bothering me or falling off.</p>
<p>3. The Anker Ultra Slim extended battery case.</p>
<p>If I’m traveling lightly, I don’t want extra bulk charging packs and cables, so the Anker battery case is ideal. It’s also great when my battery is running low, and I&#8217;m on the move, I just grab the case and know my iPhone will last another two days.</p>
<h3><strong><img class="size-full wp-image-1203 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Hemant-Mendiratta.jpg" alt="Hemant Mendiratta" width="250" height="250" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Hemant-Mendiratta.jpg 250w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Hemant-Mendiratta-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></strong>Hemant Mendiratta &#8211; <a href="https://www.techuntold.com/" name="hemant">TechUntold</a></h3>
<p><strong>Anker Battery Case</strong> &#8211; My favorite iPhone accessories are the ones that are seamless. Accessories where I have to carry a separate gadget become a hassle. The Anker Battery Case is a phone case that doubles as a charger. It protects your phone while adding that extra battery life you need.</p>
<p>A dead battery situation almost takes you 200 years back because we do everything on our phones, including that important Uber ride at 1 AM in the morning and communicating through Whatsapp or Facebook Messenger to your friends.</p>
<p>The Anker Case packs a 2850 mAh battery that they promise gives you an extra 60 hours of Audio, 13 hours of Video and 12 Hours of Browsing. You also get an audio jack extender with this case.</p>
<p>It’s a must have for people who are worried about losing battery at any point in time.</p>
<p><strong>Top Case for the iPhone</strong> &#8211; One of the situations that I fear is when I have to work when I’m traveling. I can check emails and look at updates, but my actual work involves writing content and replying to emails I don’t want to carry an iPad and for me, the best situation is getting a case like the TOP case, which has a QWERTY keyboard that comes part of the case. I can use With this case you can work continuously for 30 hours. If you are on holiday and exploring and don’t want to carry an iPad or a laptop with you, carry the TOP case.</p>
<p><strong>Mountie</strong> &#8211; It is an excellent gadget that lets you hook your iPhone to your laptop with a simple gadget. You can use the Mountie to keep your iPhone right next to the monitor.</p>
<p>This is useful for checking notifications on your phone and copying some important information. Developers can also use it as a multi-screen by having a laptop and a tablet right next to each other. The only downside to Mountie is that it does not work with desktops!</p>

<p><strong>Protecting Case</strong> &#8211; My number 1 iPhone accessory will always be a good case. I&#8217;m currently using a LifeProof on my 6S. A few things I love about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The way it keeps the iPhone from getting scratched and cracked.</li>
<li>Part of this is in the presence of casing itself.</li>
<li>LifeProof changes the weight and feel of the phone in a way that is somehow, magically, able to decrease the likelihood that I drop it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Waterproofing &#8211; I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;ve never tried submersion but I love that I can use my phone in the shower for listening to music, texting, and checking my email. I also appreciate that it&#8217;s protected when I drop it in puddles&#8230; I will say, though, that the LifeProof is far from my perfect case. The screen over the camera decreases the photo quality such that I may as well be using my first flip phone. It also makes it very difficult for people to hear me on phone calls, and vice versa.</p>
<p>This alone pretty much negates about half the usefulness of the case, as I&#8217;m constantly peeling it off to either take a photo or make a call. (Maybe someone else will recommend a better case for your article!)</p>
<p>Regardless, with how expensive iPhones are, my top pick for an accessory is something to protect my investment.</p>

<p><strong>Wireless Charger Kit</strong> &#8211; This is a very portable accessory which I use in my day to day life. It charges really quick and saves my time really well in urgency. Plus it is really safe and durable to use as well as there is no fear of overcharging or phone sliding.</p>
<p>i<strong>Phone Lens</strong> &#8211; Being a travel maniac, I love to have an iPhone lens kit with me wherever I go as it turns my phone into a DSLR camera. The lens can easily attach to my iPhone as the clasp opens around 120”. Plus it comes with a case for safety purposes.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone Flash Drive</strong> &#8211; I use a USB flash drive for fast storage or file transfer which provides speed up to 26MB/s reading speed, 10MB/s writing speed. Be it photos or videos, the flash drive makes it super easy for me to transfer them all from my iPhone. The portability and performance are superb.</p>
<p>For me, my favorite would be the iPhone Lens as it is much more than an accessory, it gives me the freedom to explore the world with just my phone in the best way possible.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I17W2YK/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">HooToo iPhone Lightning Flash Drive USB 3.0 Adapter</a></strong> &#8211; I have tried several types of flash drives for my iOS devices and eventually, I think this one is the best. The transfer speed is amazing as it’s faster than all my previous drives.</p>
<p>It can read up to 80 MB/s and write up to 40MB/s. The size and weight are perfectly portable so I can easily carry it with me whether I’m working or traveling.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGQM2LL/A/iphone-6-6s-smart-battery-case-white">Apple Smart Battery Case</a></strong> &#8211; This case is more expensive than competing models but I think it’s totally worth it. Unlike most other iPhone battery cases, it is built much tougher, not easy to be broken and works with Lightning cables.</p>
<p>The one-piece design feels really comfortable and is sleek. With the case fully charged and my iPhone inside, I’m still at 100% by late afternoon. By 11 p.m, the case’s battery was expended but the iPhone still have about 65% percent charge left.</p>

<p>The best accessories iPhone can support are falsely assumed to be expensive. The truth is that the best accessories rarely require you to whip out more than $50.</p>
<p>The first accessory I recommend is Belkin Lightning Audio and Charger RockStar. I haven’t understood why they did away with the audio jack on the iPhone 7. It’s only a matter of time before we misplace our wireless headphones, so the cable is really an investment; because it lets you charge your phone as well as listen to music at the same time through the same port. It costs a mere 40 bucks too!</p>
<p>Then, there’s the iHome Mini Speaker Cube which comes for all of 17 dollars and still delivers quite a performance. In fact, it can be used for any device with a 3.5mm jack, and also supports FM Radio</p>
<p>But the biggest issue with phones today is that we can’t get enough of them. So a longer cord is pretty essential as well. I find EnacFire Lighting cable pack of 3 ft, six ft and ten ft especially useful. It’s great because you can choose to keep a special cord for your desk in the office and save the longer one for the bedroom to snuggle and binge watch movies on a Sunday.</p>

<p>I’ve been a proud iPhone user for more than a year now. During the little experience that I have had while using iPhone, there were quite a few accessories that made my life easier.</p>
<p>I would like to place the <strong>iPhone charging dock station</strong> first on the list. I love the sight of my iPhone standing straight while getting charged, without hanging on to any wires. It complements my room as well.</p>
<p>Next up, is the <strong>iPhone car holder</strong>. It’s a tad bit difficult task to pick up a call, play music or even access the iPhone while driving unless you have a flexible iPhone car holder.</p>
<p>Along with it, Siri helps a lot to take things hands-free and make the driving hassle free.</p>
<p>The last one is a sleek and simple <strong>iPhone case</strong>. I get paranoid if I find a visible dirt on my iPhone. Now, I stay miles away from all the graphical iPhone cases.</p>
<p>I prefer a soft, durable and transparent iPhone case. It holds the slim look of my iPhone and provides the required protection at the same time.</p>
<p>My personal favorite among them is the iPhone car holder. I really enjoy my time in the car and it&#8217;s all because of the convenience being provided by the iPhone car holder.</p>
<h3><strong><img class="size-full wp-image-1204 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Chris-Schneider.jpg" alt="Chris Schneider" width="250" height="225" /></strong>Chris Schneider &#8211; <a href="http://awesome-drones.com/" name="chris">Awesome-Drones.com</a></h3>
<p>iPhone’s are extremely popular these days, despite the stiff competition from other phone manufacturers apple is still going strong and alone in 2016 they sold 1 billion units, yeah I know that&#8217;s crazy.</p>
<p>Even after Steve Job’s passing people camp 24 hours outside apple stores whenever there is a new iPhone launch just so they can get their hands on the latest models proves just how devoted this fan base really is.</p>
<p>With the growing popularity of these phones, it&#8217;s no wonder that many the accessories market has exploded with an endless choice, from cases of any color of the rainbow, to selfie sticks, Case wallets and you name it.</p>
<p>I know it can be confusing to decide what accessories you really need for your iPhone, so iv compiled a mini list of the top 3 accessories I think to cover a whole range of activities, so without further hesitation let&#8217;s jump straight to them.</p>
<p><strong>Mad Catz Micro C.T.R.L.i Mobile Gamepad</strong> &#8211; This little gadget turns your iPhone into a portable gaming console, think Nintendo DS but way more fun and useful. It connects seamlessly with your phone via Bluetooth and has an adjustable clip, so your iPhone can fit snug into it. It comes with an official apple certification, which means you will have no problems make good use of it. With the AAA batteries you can expect around 35 40 hours game time from the controller alone, this is good for people that tend to travel or commute a lot the ideal scenario would be on the bus, train or plane.</p>
<p><strong>XENVO Premium Camera Lens Kit</strong> &#8211; Smartphone photography, who doesn&#8217;t do it, these days you don&#8217;t need an expensive and heavy DSLR camera to take great pictures, you just need a relatively new smartphone and perhaps if you want to turn things up a notch you can even use the Xenvo lens kit on your iPhone for better results.</p>
<p>Basically it’s a mini wide angle that attaches to your iPhone&#8217;s front or back facing camera and it gives you 45% more picture without losing out on any quality, also if you like to take close of pictures of food or flowers then you can do that too with the Macro lens feature, so now you can start shooting fancy pictures for you Instagram account.</p>
<p><strong>Multifunctional iPhone Case</strong> &#8211; Or like how I like to call this case (Party Survival Case) this protective housing for your iPhone has definitely covered you at any party you go, let’s agree that smartphones have already a ton of functionality as is, like planners, music players, communication, games and so on, with this case it adds a layer of physical capabilities like beer opener, cigarette lighter and you can also attach it on your bicycle&#8217;s steering handles, so you would agree if I say that Chuck Norris would be proud of this case.</p>

<p>Apple is a universal brand and people love it. You can make your Apple iPhone even more interesting if you use different accessories, because a mobile is not everything in itself, for instance, you need a cable or charger to charge the mobile. In a similar manner, there are other accessories of Apple which you will find much more interesting and here are three that I think are the best</p>
<p><strong>Travel USB Cables:</strong> ordinary iPhone cables work perfectly well, but when it comes to the matter of traveling, space matters and for this reason, you must switch to shorter and highly-reliable travel cables that you can easily put in your pocket.</p>
<p><strong>External Battery:</strong> the first thing that many people consider when buying any mobile is the battery timing. Apple users always find it exhausting and frustrating to charge their mobile again and again. It is really a trouble when you are traveling and your mobile battery is dead. You can buy an external battery that will charge the mobile: it’s a great accessory.</p>
<p><strong>Laptop Backpack:</strong> If you have a Mac or an iPad then you certainly need a proper backpack to carry the Mac, iPad and their accessories. It is really difficult to carry these things without a proper bag, therefore you should buy one.</p>

<p>The first thing came to my mind is the <strong>Apple&#8217;s Lightning dock</strong>, it makes those 3.5 MM jack headphones useful again. Since there are people out there (including me) who wants to use their favorite wired headphones and charge the phone, both at the same time.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty ointment to me and not costs that much. And I&#8217;m really not obsessed with the AirPods. Wait, should I be?</p>
<p><strong>Gekkopod</strong> is so cool as it&#8217;s a five-legged animal, oh, It looks like it but it&#8217;s a mobile tripod. Using its arms that just needs to wrap around a solid object makes it possible to mount an iPhone anywhere. You can also tilt the phone 360 degrees using its Ballhead accessory.</p>
<p>I’m a blogger and I spent more than 12 hours staring the computer screen, but things could slightly change with the <strong>Stand-alone keyboard</strong>, it makes typing a detailed email more accurate than typing on the touch glass.</p>

<p><strong>Portable Charger</strong> &#8211; A study that we did at finder.com.au last year found that Aussies will go to the most desperate measures to charge their phone (see <a href="https://www.finder.com.au/the-most-desperate-things-australians-do-to-charge-their-phones">full analysis here</a>). These ranged from using a powerpoint in an office building they had no business visiting to even hanging in a public toilet.

<p><strong>Speakers</strong> &#8211; Wireless speakers have blown up in popularity over the last few years. They are the quickest and easiest way to listen to your music wherever you go. Their portability means they’re great for parties or barbecues at the local park.</p>

<p>Being an avid iPhone guy for years now, I have come to realize you don&#8217;t need a lot of accessories to make the most out of your iPhone. In fact, the more accessories you have the less productive the phone becomes. I look for accessories that highlight the phone and not take away from it.</p>
<p><strong>A dash holder. I</strong> like sleek phones so cases bother me. So a simple magnet on the back does the trick.</p>
<p><strong>Wireless headphones</strong> with a good mic. I do business often on the road. Quality headphones play a large role in that.</p>
<p><strong>AppleTV</strong> is more than an accessory but it&#8217;s a perfect tool to take your iPhone to the next level. We utilize it for company meetings and more.<br />

<p><strong>1. Heavy Case.</strong> Silk’s Base Grip is the best all-around iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus case for most people. We know from years of feedback from readers, staff, and even family and friends that most people want a case that’s slim, plainly designed, reliably protective, and inexpensive. That’s exactly what you get with the Base Grip.</p>
<p><strong>2. Tagrus Cable</strong>. It has one of the finest material, it works as good as the original. Technically, it gives 2A output as this much required which is quite efficient for your iPhone.</p>
<p><strong>3. Powerbank Mi 20000mAh.</strong> It has the fast charging 2A support with 1.5A support. If you want a good power bank then this is the best choice for your iPhone.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m more interested in the accessories which are of great use in day-to-day usage:</p>
<p><strong>SanDisk Connect Wireless Stick 64 GB Pen Drive </strong>&#8211; If you are someone who travels a lot and likes to watch movies or videos on your iPhone then this one is must for you. This wireless Stick doesn&#8217;t cost that much and allows you to access data on your iPhone or even on your Android on-the-air anywhere without even requiring an Internet connection.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth Speaker</strong> &#8211; For a music lover surviving without Headphones or a Bluetooth speaker is difficult. If you are not willing to spend much on Bluetooth Speakers then you can go with budget oriented Bluetooth Speakers like JBL Flip 3, JBL Charge 2(Recommended), Sony XRS XB3 which costs less than $150. I&#8217;ve been using JBL Charge 2 for 5 months and it&#8217;s definitely worth the price.</p>
<p><strong>Power Bank</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s always good to have some power backup in case your iPhone&#8217;s battery runs out. Invest in power banks which are easily available and not very expensive.</p>
<p>Personally, I would recommend Xiaomi Mi 20000 mAh Power Bank. For iPhone 7 users, make sure you have a good quality USB Type-C cable for your power bank.</p>

<p><strong>Spigen Liquid Crystal Case</strong> &#8211; You may ask what is special in this case which makes it different from the rest? Well this case, first of all, looks pretty elegant thanks to the clear design. Apart from this, the case feels premium and robust in hands.</p>
<p>There will be times when the iPhone will slip from your hands, and this protective case will save you from burning a big hole in your pocket. So if you are buying iPhone then definitely make sure to buy this along else you may regret your decision later.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Smart Battery Case </strong>&#8211; Let get this straight. Apple has to improve the iPhone&#8217;s Battery life because iPhones are inferior in battery backup and it will be very hard to get to the end of the day with just one charge.</p>
<p>So if you are the one who doesn&#8217;t like to sit near the power outlet and use your iPhone while it&#8217;s connected to the charger, then this is for you.</p>
<p>It surely is priced a bit on higher side, but that&#8217;s what makes Apple different from rest of the mobile phone manufacturers.</p>
<p><strong>Desk Charger and Sync Dock Stand</strong> &#8211; This Desk Charger is also a good choice to buy as if you are working in a corporate it will save you from the hectic of connecting your iPhone again and again to your desk computer. It is directly attached to the computer via USB port, and you can just connect your iPhone to the dock stand. Apart from all this it also charges your smartphone side by side.</p>

<p><strong>Car Mounts </strong>&#8211; Smart and safe driving is important for all cell phone users. There are several great mounts on the market that easily clip onto the air conditioning vents of the car and enable a smooth and quick connection process. These mounts also limit texting and driving because it is more difficult to send off that &#8220;quick&#8221; text when the phone is mounted to your dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>Wallet Cases</strong> &#8211; We love a good wallet case. There are several cheap protective cases that have spaces for credit cards and a few dollars in cash. These cases not only free up space in a purse or bag, they also help keep everything in one place to reduce the risk of losing money or credit cards. We have found that most iPhone users look after the phone with much more diligence than their wallet and if both are in the same place, it is more difficult to lose them!</p>
<p><strong>Portable Chargers</strong> &#8211; Especially for business owners and people on the go for most of the day, having a portable charger is a must-have accessory. For many people, their phones are the key source of their business and a period of no battery could result in the loss of income. There are several small portable chargers out there that are easy to store and do not take up too much space.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the top three basic iPhone accessories that every power user should have are <strong>the headphones</strong>, as they sit comfortably in my ears. I use them on a daily basis, whether I go to the gym or simply sit at my desk. From a technical viewpoint, their quality is one of the best on the market.</p>
<p>Another accessory is the<strong> lightning charging cable.</strong> It has a slick and simple design, yet their use ubiquitous.</p>
<p>And last, but not least, in our modern society, you cannot go without a <strong>powerful external battery</strong>. I strongly consider that this accessory requires no explanation what so ever for the people that are connected day in and day out.</p>

<p>Here are my 3 recommended accessories for your iPhone.</p>
<p><strong>HooToo Flash Drive</strong> &#8211; For extra storage space &amp; USB. It&#8217;s an MFi-certified small flash drive with storage space up to 64 GB with a connector at one end &amp; USB 3.0 at other. Which can be used as a storage device and also for transfer.</p>
<p><strong>Mad Catz Micro C.T.R.L.i Mobile Gamepad</strong> &#8211; GamePad for Gamers</p>
<p>This is a gamepad for the hardcore gamer who loves joystick style of playing. It works with IOS 7 &amp; above and works with Bluetooth connection. It comes with AAA batteries and has 40 hours of GamePlay.</p>
<p>A <strong>selfie stick</strong> is a must have accessory for selfie lovers. When it comes to camera nothing can beat iPhone. Adding a Bluetooth selfie stick which can extend to 31 inches with 270-degree rotation will be an enhancement to it.</p>
<p>Thought the selfie stick can be replaced by a JBL Bluetooth speaker or a Beat&#8217;s on the ear headset, but again it depends on individual passion on it.</p>

<p><strong>Lifeproof Cases</strong> &#8211; These cases are great and very very popular amongst our users, simply for the fact that they are waterproofing the phone, and also impact resistant to prevent accidental drops.</p>
<p><strong>Mophie Juice Packs</strong> &#8211; With longer consumption of the iPhone, there&#8217;s never enough power for it to last throughout an entire day. The Mophie cases are perfect companion cases for power users.</p>
<p><strong>Story Leather Holsters</strong> &#8211; This is a shameless plug of my company&#8217;s own product. This is more than a product, as it&#8217;s a custom made to order service that custom tailors a case to fit the iPhone.</p>
<p>Nowadays, everyone put their iPhones in a case, but all cases come in different sizes (or shapes), and as cases get bigger, they become hard to slide into a pocket.</p>
<p>This is where our leather holsters come into place, we custom tailor a case to fit regardless of how big/small your phone is, and best of all, you can get to choose from over 100 different genuine leather colors/textures, and create that one of a kind luxury piece to house your iPhone.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://bellroy.com/products/phone-wallet/i7/tamarillo">Belkin Phone Wallet</a></strong> &#8211; This is a great combination high-quality case with room for cards and cash together with your phone and gives excellent protection. My iPhone has survived more than one fall inside this case, the last time face down from 3 feet onto a stone floor. My iPhone escaped unscathed without a scratch. I&#8217;ve used my case daily for over a year and it still looks like new.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GFA1ZCU/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Syncwire Charging Cable</a></strong> &#8211; The one advantage that this cable has over the regular plastic charging cables is that it&#8217;s made from braided nylon so it won&#8217;t fray.</p>

<p>If you travel frequently you&#8217;ll know that there are times when your iPhone runs low on power and there isn&#8217;t a convenient charging point available. Or perhaps you need to charge both your iPhone and your laptop at the same time and you only have one power adaptor for the country that you&#8217;re in.</p>
<p>This small, lightweight charging unit will charge your phone quickly and you can use it to fully charge your iPhone twice or even three times before you need to recharge the battery itself.</p>
<p>Mine lives in my laptop bag and is always there as power &#8220;insurance&#8221; if my iPhone runs low. Being portable I can just keep the phone attached to the charger in my bag or jacket pocket if I need to charge whilst I&#8217;m on the move.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t use mine often but it&#8217;s great knowing that I have it if I need it. On my last long haul flight to Australia, I used it to charge my iPhone on the plane as I was charging my laptop from the USB connection at my seat.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve personally used the PowerCore+ mini with my iPhone 6 Plus for over a year now. I think that the PowerCore 5000 would probably be a better choice for iPhone 6S and 7.</p>
<div class="yb">If you travel regularly invest in a separate charger, cable and a power adaptor for multiple countries for your iPhone and then leave them in your regular travel bag. The cost is pretty minimal, you&#8217;ll never need to worry about forgetting to pack chargers, cables or adaptors again and you know that you&#8217;ll always have power whenever and wherever you need it.</div>

It helps because it increases phone&#8217;s batter by 26 hours of talk time or you can use 22 hours internet or it can play videos for 24 hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KIRJ1FY/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">iPhone SUPCASE Armband</a> &#8211; Whenever I go for a run I always carry my phone with me but it&#8217;s very difficult to carry the phone in hand all the way. In this case, I use SUPCASE Armband. It is very comfortable and keeps the iPhone secure too. It also allows you to access the home button and it is adjustable and breathable armband. It is very easy to insert and remove the iPhone from this armband.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019ZVL418/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Jorno Ultra-Thin Folding Mobile Keyboard</a> &#8211; This thing really worked great for me and the design of this keyword is very attractive. The best part of this KB is you just have to sync it once with your phone and then you just have to unfold the keyboard and start typing. The key size is only 9% smaller than standard size, so it gives the feel of standard size keyboard.</p>

<p><strong>Card Case</strong> &#8211; This is necessary and important because it&#8217;s easy to drop your phone and scratch it. But more importantly is that the case stores a few credit cards. This makes it easier to pay when eating out or grabbing a cup of coffee without having to pull out your wallet. The best part is that these cases are very slim and the designs are minimal and don&#8217;t add a lot of bulk to your phone.</p>
<p><strong>Headphones</strong> &#8211; Every person has a headphone preference, but these are better than the earbuds because they block out the noise and the sound quality is better. The best part is that headphones have become a fashion accessory and there&#8217;s no need to put them in your bag, wearing them or just having it wrapped around you has become widely popular.</p>
<p><strong>Camera lens attachment</strong> &#8211; The cameras on the phone are great. However, there are times a camera lens attachment comes in handy for different angles and views that the camera itself doesn&#8217;t capture. The best part is that these lenses are small and minimalist and stick on securely.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.belkin.com/au/p/P-F8M978/">Belkin Car Mount</a> &#8211; Gone are the days of standalone GPS systems. Every iPhone owner now days uses their phone to navigate while driving. So make life easy with a brilliant iPhone Car Mount that can fit any size iPhone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jbl.com/bluetooth-speakers/JBL+CHARGE+III.html">JBL Charge 3 Speaker</a> &#8211; The sound from your iPhone is okay, but not great. One of the best accessories you can get is a quality but affordable Bluetooth speaker. The JBL Charge 3, in particular, has great sound, with reasonable volume and comes waterproof. I have one, trust me they are awesome.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.belkin.com/au/p/P-F8J198/">Belkin Audio + Charge Rockstar</a> &#8211; Some people were happy with the removal of the iPhone 3.5mm jack. However, for those who are not and have spent $300 of their beats by Dre the Belkin Audio Adapter is what you need.</p>

<p><strong>HooToo Flash Drive:</strong><br />
It is really common that people don&#8217;t go for high storage capacity when buying iPhone as Apple do charges for their storage space. If you are one of those who has purchased iPhone with 16GB memory space then you are well aware that it is not sufficient for you. HooToo Flash Drive is a flash drive with 3.0 port with 64gb storage. It`s is very handy.</p>
<p><strong>Anker A7908 Bluetooth Speaker:</strong><br />
We al love the sound which is not just audible or loud but also known as quality sound. When it comes boosting the sound I recommend Anker A7908 Bluetooth speaker. It is a 2-inch speaker which is very handy with 20 hours playback capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Monoprice Battery Backup:</strong><br />
Battery drain is the big issue in all smartphones including iPhone also. It is always advisable to carry an extra battery or a power backup for your smartphone. I recommend using Monoprice battery backup. It is a 2600mAH with LED light. It also shows that how much battery left in power backup.</p>

<p><strong>Apple Air pods:<br />
</strong>With the introduction of Apple iPhone 7, the company made a huge change in its most successful product by removing the audio jack from the phone. This came to people as a big surprise and they were wondering how this phone is going to sell if it is unable to connect with an earphone. Actually, the company was thinking a step ahead of everyone and then they introduced the world to Apple Air pods. Apple Air pods are total wireless earphones for your Apple iPhone 7. This is an accessory that looks crazy but when it comes to functionality it works really fine. It has a great sound, it connects to your phone easily and most importantly you won’t have to deal with your old strangled earphones anymore.</p>

Apple iPhone 7 smart battery case is an excellent accessory for your iPhone and it is best for those who are tired of charging their Apple iPhones again and again. This accessory looks like a cover case, a backpack for your iPhone which carries an extra battery. It might not be the best looking iPhone accessory but it is certainly the most useful one.

<p>My favorite iPhone accessories are:</p>
<p><strong>1. Belkin Lightning Audio + Charge Rockstar</strong></p>
<p>I recommend this to iPhone users because you can use your device for charging and can listen music at the same time. Simply, it&#8217;s a lightning port splitter.</p>
<p><strong>2. HooToo Flash Drive</strong></p>
<p>Storage for 16GB or 32GB variants is a big issue. This handy, compact flash drive can potentially help out. It has a Lightning connector at one end and a USB 3.0 port at the other. In the middle, there’s 64GB of storage for you to fill with photos, movies, or other files. It’s easy to slip into a pocket or bag, it transfers files quickly via a handy app, and it offers an alternative backup method that doesn’t require a cable. It is also MFi-certified.</p>
<p><strong>3. Mujjo Touchscreen Gloves</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easy to use your phone in winters, you can&#8217;t use your device with gloves but they allow you to touch your phone with warm gloves.. For colder climes, we recommend the double-layered gloves, available in three sizes with a magnetic clasp for a snug fit. They’re really comfortable, warm, and stylish at the same time. Mujjo does also offer basic varieties for a bit less, or you can splash out on a leather pair.</p>

<div class="su-tabs su-tabs-style-default my-custom-tabs" data-active="1"><div class="su-tabs-nav"><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Graphics</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">RAM &amp; Processor</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Power Efficiency</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Display</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Storage</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Audio</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Battery</span></div><div class="su-tabs-panes"><div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>The graphics processor is what matters in gaming laptops. It is the component, which determines whether the game loads at 6 or 60 frames per second. A gaming laptop is all about the fast loading graphics.</p>
<p>It’s safe to say that only a great graphics processor would justify the billing.</p>
<p>A few more components must be present to compliment even the mightiest graphics processor.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geforce.com/whats-new/articles/geforce-gtx-900m-laptops-available-now">NVidia 900 series</a> and to an extent, the 800 series has managed to create a similar impact in the graphic processor market.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>Speaking of supporting components, main processor and system RAM are your immediate priorities.</p>
<p>Irrespective of other specs, these two factors alone determines the range of your laptop. The benchmark for RAM and processor has rocketed, in regards to best laptops for gaming.</p>
<p>The choice of processors is often won hands down by either Intel or NVidia and rightly so. They perform a lot smoother and efficient than the standard alternative, AMD. The sixth generation <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/family/88392/6th-Generation-Intel-Core-i7-Processors#@Desktop">Intel processor</a> has upped the range in regards to power efficiency.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>The power efficiency would translate to the ultimate gaming experience. Another desirable benefit would be the easy maintenance of your device.</p>
<p>Power efficient processors don’t let your laptop get excessively heated. The cooling effect is a must-have factor in gaming laptops. The best laptops for gamers 2017 is expected to tick this critical box.</p>
<p>When you have games with gameplay over a dozen hours, a heated laptop is the last thing you would wish for. It should come as an unwanted disturbance, making your gaming experience terrible. The heating effect is the sole reason, AMD processors are preferred a lot less than Intel.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>Another important component which is often overlooked when making your choice amongst the best gaming laptops 2017 is the display.</p>
<p>What matters is what you see in regards to quality of modern age games. In retro-gaming, it was all about finding a pattern. But games of this millennium are all about getting a feel of it as quickly as possible. Resolutions like Full HD or 1920x1080p alone can exactly deliver what you need.</p>
<p>4K is a far superior resolution, but opting for it would be a little too early for now. Nonetheless, don’t bother too much about brightness- contrast ratios. Practical anti-glare finishes have become mandatory for today’s gaming laptops.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>Storage cannot be overlooked while assessing best laptops for gamers. It won’t speed up your games for sure. But it can prove handy in reducing the delay between each level.</p>
<p>It serves on practicality by helping to speed up boot and file operations. SSD is the buzzword for the last couple of years. You can’t be content with anything less than that as a hardcore gamer.</p>
<p>An additional high capacity disk within your laptop wouldn’t hurt too. You can keep the additional solid drive for saving games.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>After visuals, audio is the first thing you must focus on.</p>
<p>Though using headsets would feel lovely for gaming, your gaming laptop must bag excellent built-in stereo speakers also. Most modern gaming laptops operate very quietly. There won’t be much noise to cause disturbance during intense gaming.</p>
<p>When paired with a <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/10-best-gaming-keyboards-1295703">gaming keyboard</a>, chances of annoying keystrokes are also eliminated. Some bespoke audio systems have made their mark to laptop speakers in the last 2-3 years. Such brands include Harman, Onkyo, B&amp;O and more. You may choose to up the ante by setting up home theater or sound surround.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>Last but not least, battery life shouldn’t be counted out, when choosing your gaming laptop.</p>
<p>The toughest challenge any manufacturer has is to present decent battery life. It’s not every day you go looking for a desktop replacement gaming laptop. For gaming, you need a long run off battery in every cycle. However combining fast graphic and superior battery life is one really hard challenge.</p>
<p>Amongst the best gaming laptops 2017, you might have to compromise on battery life more often than not. It is frequently compromised for the sake of superior configuration and key specifications.</div></div></div>
<div class="redb">
<p><strong>The gaming laptops also come with few hiccups and limitations, which you must be aware of. So, let&#8217;s have a look at few of the limitations.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost, the Heat issues. Professional Gaming laptops accomplish each and every task with full potential which results in the great amount of heat.</li>
<li>Battery life is also a headache when it comes to gaming machines. Most of the manufacturers are messing with battery life and still there is no any laptop with a great battery backup. The average battery backup from a gaming laptop is 4-5 hours maximum.</li>
<li>Weight! Ohh, trust me weight sucks! They are so heavy and aren&#8217;t that much portable. The average weight is 7-8 pounds.</li>
<li>Gaming laptops are very expensive. You must have a good amount of money if you are on a hunt for the best laptop for gaming.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YR6BNVS/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">ASUS RoG G751JY</a> &#8211; Best Gaming Laptop 2017</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-225" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ASUS-RoG-G751JY.jpg" alt="ASUS RoG G751JY Review" width="800" height="300" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ASUS-RoG-G751JY.jpg 800w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ASUS-RoG-G751JY-300x113.jpg 300w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ASUS-RoG-G751JY-768x288.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3>Key Specifications</h3>
<div class="blueb">
<ul>
<li>CPU: Core i7, 2.6GHz</li>
<li>RAM: 24 GB, extendable up to 32 GB</li>
<li>Display size: 17.3”</li>
<li>Touchpad size: 4.74”x2.6”</li>
<li>Native Resolution: 1920&#215;1080</li>
<li>Graphics Card: NVidia GeForce GTX 980M</li>
<li>Wi-Fi: 802.11ac, Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260</li>
<li>Weight: 8.4 pounds</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Like any annual upgrade to a model, there hasn’t been a revolution. However, the killer specs always make this model exciting. The bonuses are more stylish looks and incredible bump in performance.</p>
<p>The hype around this model has been huge and it had lived up to it. Almost 0 latency rate resulting in smooth graphics, thanks largely to NVidia’s G-Sync technology, makes G751JY, gamer’s favorite.</p>
<p>High 60’s fps at high settings makes G751JY fast, but not the fastest. In similar settings, Dominator Pro or even Alienware 17 would give you 70-80 fps.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say NVidia G-Sync technology has bolstered the performance with some serious graphics. The serious graphical power is nice to have alongside breathtaking good looks. Lightning fast transfer speeds plus terrific display make it a whole lot better.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> ASUS RoG G751JY is worth the hype and big budget.</p>

<p>Baby faced assassin would be the right expletive to describe Alienware 13. The cutest outlook may mask the raging beast that lies beneath.</p>
<p>Like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B015P3SJD6/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Alienware 17</a>, Alienware 13 also features a backlit keyboard that lies between the bright power button and giant touchpad. Alienware command center adds a novice dimension to gaming. It improves personalization and customization to its finest.</p>
<p>You wouldn’t be wrong to call Alienware as mutants within the gaming laptop market. Alienware 13 also managed to combine the best of portability and performance. Long battery life and superior display resolution are nice bonuses to have. Pair it with a gaming amplifier to get yourself an official gaming beast.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Alienware 13 pioneers gaming laptops in direction of making versatile devices.</p>

<p>The design of this beast would look similar to none. Such a design manages to accommodate loads of hardware and cooling facilities. 18.4” display should speak volumes about how much of a desk space needs to be spared.</p>
<p>The extra room created in parallel at keyboard area makes up for an all-purpose touchpad. The touchpad doubles up as a numeric pad when required.</p>
<p>When speaking notebooks, you might not come across GT80 level specs that often. The heavy configuration comes at a cost. It adds up to huge size which can’t be moved around easily. It may not even fit a standard laptop bag. Barring all the negatives, the model is still a hard-sell on the basis of performance alone.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> GT80 is the like for like replacement for your desktop.</p>

<p>You may now be wondering what the catch is. What else could it be other than its high price? Even after shelling out a few grand, you would still be hoping the model plays next year games well. The newest Razer Blade got a lot lighter and more colorful. Strong specs are going to tempt your wallet to death.</p>
<p>Hyper-threading processor and competitive processor speed are the irresistible features of Razer Blade 14. Improved fan design is the vital minor adjustment, which would make things cooler. Being cheaper than last year’s model while bettering the performance, this is the most sensible upgrade.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> If you can afford Razer Blade 14 now, you are in luck.</p>

</div>
<p>Lack of touch feature makes this model unable to cash out on its large screen size. Portability isn’t its strong suit considering the screen size of 17” and weight of 6.6 pounds. Lenovo hasn’t come up with aggressive pricing on this product either. Summing it up, the Z70 is relatively mediocre at the top 10 gaming laptops 2017 list. Amongst the best features is its astronomical performance. It can be bettered by turbo boosting processor to 2.7 GHz.</p>
<p>Lenovo Z70 is as flashy as it is expensive. The full HD screen is definitely going to appeal to the multimedia masses. Missing out on the backlit keyboard can hardly be justified for the price. For no reasons, you should overlook this model. However, this isn’t really special in any aspect.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Strong performance singlehandedly puts Z70 in the list of best gaming laptops 2017.</p>

<p>Hewlett Packard has reinvented the wheel with inventive gaming laptop design of the decade. Gamers are going to feel less shy carrying this slim laptop. Its extravagant design is going to put every other laptop design to shame. The pricing is pretty reasonable from the brand which isn’t quite known for that. Not many gamers would, however, be impressed with 51 fps in the high setting. I really like the keyboard of this laptop. It is like a <a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/best-gaming-keyboards/">professional gaming keyboard</a> with backlit and programmable macro keys.</p>
<p>Omen is sleek, quick and powerful with very few shortcomings. First in the list must be its poor battery life. 16 GB RAM must prove adequate for any number of heavy programs. Excellent fan design creates an amazing cooling effect.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> A few upgrades surely make it the go-to gaming machine.</p>

<p>This model is definitely future proof at this price range. Mid-range high-end gaming laptops don&#8217;t pack these many features often. The configuration feels adequately done for its price. Even high graphic activity doesn’t seem to disturb the smooth running of this machine. Built quality may be the major complaint from the gaming universe. Trackpad quality isn’t worthy of a mention too.</p>
<p>With a minimalistic design, this isn’t a drool-worthy product. Nevertheless, it didn’t fail at ticking all the critical boxes. Gamers, as well as programmers, wouldn’t have too many complaints with this gaming workhorse. This super-fast computer serves adequately in all aspects, barring its plastic body. It feels a lot lighter and is one of the ultra-portable gaming laptops in the market.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> As a mid-range laptop this MSI model is recommendable.</p>

<p>Consider Acer Predator must be considered an investment, especially when you are intimidated by its high asking price. The design has been striking, thanks to the red and black color scheme. The gigantic predator logo confirms the fact, the laptop has some attitude.</p>
<p>At low, Predator can achieve up to 160 fps. At high settings again, an extraordinary 80 fps can be achieved. The 16 GB RAM should raise your expectations about performance. The display has a plethora of colors, but the upper limit of just 1080p is concerning. Four speakers and two subwoofers take care of the audio.</p>
<p>The touchpad and keypad have upped the ante as well. Predator 17 doesn’t produce scorching heat even after long hours of high-performance gaming.</p>
<p>It may cost a fortune. But it offers some unique advantages in the price range, such as longer battery life. Though it is not exactly the portable type, its bulky design isn’t a letdown too.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> The model is definitely worth the premium paid.</p>

<p>At 10 pounds you can describe the gaming notebook as chunky at best. It is not exactly the portable type. 8GB of video memory comes as a relief in this, otherwise lackluster configuration. For the fact, those minor victories are the reason why the laptop has made it to the top ten, this year.</p>
<p>The 17” screen beats every 14” and 15” when it comes to hardcore gaming. Keyboard highlights don&#8217;t impress too much with too many meaningless highlights.</p>
<p>The first turn off with this gaming device is the noisy fan. You got to trust us, these fans can come between you and gaming enjoyment. Had it not for this, the hardware is just perfect to create awesome gaming experience. Moreover, the upper limit of 30fps doesn’t do much justice for a gaming laptop. The performance again struggles at low fan speeds, making it the least desirable of the top 10 gaming laptops 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Barring the noisy fan, everything from performance to build is doable.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever realized that your smartphone defines your Character? Either you are an Apple Fanboy or Android Geek, you will find a lot of similarities in others who use the same smartphones as yours.</p>
<p>Which one are you, iPhone or Android?</p>
<p>Like the yin and yang, these two are constantly battling to prove their dominance over each other. It doesn&#8217;t matter if they are siblings, colleagues or in a relationship.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve collected the data from various trusted websites and institutions and have used it to create a graphical and fun to read infographic which will help you understand this behavior pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Here is an <a href="https://www.customermagnetism.com/infographics/what-is-an-infographic/">Infographic</a> of the differences between an Apple IOS user and Android user.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1103 size-full" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ios-vs-Android-Infographics.jpg" alt="ios vs Android Infographics" width="1000" height="5265" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ios-vs-Android-Infographics.jpg 1000w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ios-vs-Android-Infographics-57x300.jpg 57w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ios-vs-Android-Infographics-768x4044.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

<p><textarea style="width: 700px; height: 200px;">&lt;strong&gt;Please include attribution to 10beasts.cn with this graphic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#8221;http://www.10beasts.cn/iphone-or-android/&#8221;&gt;&lt;img src=&#8221;http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/iPhone-or-Android-Infographic.jpg&#8221; alt=&#8221;IOS Users vs Android Users&#8221; width=&#8221;1000px&#8221; border=&#8221;0&#8243; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</textarea></p>
<p>Android and Apple users are the perfect rivals. As much as they hate each other from time to time but they should know that it&#8217;s this rivalry that drives the mobile market fiercely and forces the manufacturers to keep innovating and keep giving us something new to rant about.</p>
<p>There is a very consistent pattern between the Android and Apple users. Each of these brands&#8217; user carries a very particular set of habits, lifestyle, and overall livelihood. This isn&#8217;t a random coincidence, though. Both, Android and Apple offers a very different user experience that appeals to a selected audience.</p>

<p>Among the long list of essentials, you can’t overlook gaming keyboards. When playing for long hours, you can’t help but appreciate the extra level of comfort it creates. Finest and smooth gaming experience are guaranteed along with it. Effortless play even in lengthy gaming durations is a real prospect.</p>
<p>Your gaming set up would stay unimpressive until the standard keyboard hasn’t been replaced by a gaming keyboard already.</p>

<h2>Best Gaming Keyboards 2016</h2>
<p>If I was out there to buy a Gaming Keyboard, it would be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B014W1Z4LC/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Corsair K70</a>.</p>
<p>After continuous research and testing it personally, I finally chose this one to be the best keyboard for gamers to buy in 2016. I am more than sure that you are eager to know the reasons, that why I had chosen the Corsair K70, as the best gaming keyboard 2016? Right?</p>
<p>Let me clear it for you.</p>
<div class="blueb">
<ul>
<li>First and foremost, I researched for the most trusted gaming keyboard brand among Facebook gaming groups, Gaming Platoons and on forums.<br />
(Found that <a href="http://www.corsair.com/en/gaming-keyboards">Corsair</a> is the #1 Gaming Keyboard Manufacturer).</li>
<li>I researched for the Gaming Keyboards with the best rating on Amazon. I read the customer reviews and had a close look on Customer&#8217;s satisfaction and what actually the product is offering. I found this model (K70), as the best rated and most purchased keyboard on Amazon.</li>
<li>I ask the Manufacturer to send me a keyboard for a limited time to review it, and I will include a &#8220;Buy Now&#8221; link back to your product in my article.</li>
<li>I found Corsair Keyboards (K70 and Latest K95) listed at the top on some of the famous tech blogs out there including <a href="http://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-gaming-keyboards,review-2009.html">TomsGuide</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Differences in Different Keyboard Models<br />
(Mechanical vs Membrane)</h2>
<figure id="attachment_145" style="width: 301px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-145" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Keyboard_Construction_Layer.jpg" alt="Membrane Keyboard vs Mechanical Keyboard" width="301" height="219" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Keyboard_Construction_Layer.jpg 800w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Keyboard_Construction_Layer-300x219.jpg 300w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Keyboard_Construction_Layer-768x560.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Membrane Keyboard &#8211; Image from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_keyboard">Wikipedia</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Different keyboard models include a different set of features. The only thing that stays the same is every gaming keyboard would bring lots of improvised options.</p>
<p>The primary differentiation in gaming keyboards should be the make of keys. The two categories in this regard are mechanical and membrane based keyboards. <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/M/membrane_keyboard.html">Membrane-based keyboards</a> generate signals upon touch, with the help of conductive plastic. Whereas mechanical based keyboards use physical switches, which works far better.</p>
<p>Choosing between the two would be a classic example of cost vs. quality scenario.</p>
<h2>Low-Quality Keyboards are worth Crap</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-26 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/crap.jpg" alt="crap keyboard" width="300" height="250" />Gaming keyboards are meant to make your gaming more enjoyable. Nevertheless not every gaming keyword is guaranteed to better the feel and simulation.</p>
<p>Only a few handful of gaming keyboard models gets manufactured every year.</p>
<p>From brands to type to model, quality of gaming keyboards varies widely. The broad range in regards to quality would mean there is a cheap set of electronics sitting there at the lower end of the spectrum. Making a purchase of such gaming component would only create more uneasiness.</p>
<p>That is exactly why we have compiled the list of best keyboards for gamers.</p>
<h2>1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B014W1Z4LC/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Corsair Vengeance K70 RGB</a></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Corsair-Vengeance-K70-RGB.jpg" alt="Corsair K70 Review" width="800" height="300" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Corsair-Vengeance-K70-RGB.jpg 800w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Corsair-Vengeance-K70-RGB-300x113.jpg 300w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Corsair-Vengeance-K70-RGB-768x288.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>The predecessors of K70 enjoyed all the appreciation for their simplicity. The latest model would be worth more for additional features and great software end. Amongst all factors, its design would make an impression straight away.</p>
<div class="redb"><strong>NOTE: I didn&#8217;t get the chance to try the latest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B014W1Z4S0/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Corsair K95 RGB</a>, that&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t include it in my top 10 list. However, I believe that K95 have a lot of potential as compared to K70.</strong></div>
<div class="su-tabs su-tabs-style-default my-custom-tabs" data-active="1"><div class="su-tabs-nav"><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Perfect Successor</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Exciting Additions</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Super Ergonomic</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Extra Cushion</span></div><div class="su-tabs-panes"><div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>K70 has successfully been the conceptual successor of K60. Though it doesn’t have all the features of K60 or K70 MX red, it still has most of it. Not many keyboards fit their billing along lines of succeeding the series.</p>
<p>What’s more desirable is K70 does more than just being a successor. It packs more features and looks fresh with full lit LED keys. Some extra features and aesthetics are contained in the design.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>A four-way BIOS switch is located on the dorsal side of the keyboard. The first trick such a setup pulls is, reducing the polling rate to 50%. From 1000Hz to 500Hz to even stripping back to primary BIOS mode, every instant transformation is possible.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>You have the option to keep wrist rest on and off. Gamers know the significance of an on and off wrist rest. 80-90% of it is made of plastic, which makes sense for gaming as well as productivity. The keys are also matted to make life easy for gamers, who sweat too much.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>The cherry MX red switches make K70 feel light and responsive. These switches enable fast paced gaming. Every bit of the 45g actuation force contributes to intense gaming action. Curved inwards and being rubberized, K70 keys provide that distinctive feel. Their contoured WASD keys deserve a mention in every review.</p>
<p>Their contoured WASD keys deserve a mention in this review.</p>

<h3>Our Final Verdict</h3>
<div class="blueb">
<p>K70 successfully achieves adding feel good factor, which is often ignored by manufacturers. K70 doesn&#8217;t boast a revolutionary design.</p>
<p>The design is something, where the brand has made incredible improvements to address the shortcoming of predecessors. This keyboard guarantees all-round fulfillment starting from being a 100% mechanized device. Corsair in all counts would be the first in the list.</p>

<p>Coolermaster has packed gaming keyboard and mouse together for mutually benefiting upsells. The design is expected to be basic at first look.</p>
<p>It’s one of the best mechanical keyboards from Coolermaster. You have options to choose both partial as well as complete illumination. Polling rate can be lower than 1ms. Three switch modes are available – Cherry MX Blue, Brown and Red.</p>
<p>The model has a compact dimension of <strong>14.9&#215;5.4&#215;1.3 inches</strong>. Six feet cable comes along with the device to give you that extra bit of movability.</p>

<h3>Final Verdict</h3>
<div class="blueb">
<p>FPS gamers are going to be delighted with this one. Its compactness goes hand in hand with robustness, which would prove too good for gaming.</p>
<p>The keyboard boasts an intelligent system capable of reducing its size without losing keys. Controllable illumination and programmable mouse make the product irresistible. You may be forced to order a wrist rest, but that shouldn’t come as a significant drawback,</p>

<p>The Razer BlackWidow Chroma is the best Gaming keyboard 2016 according to our views and managed to take the 3rd place in our article.</p>
<p>This keyboard is not that much great when it comes to built quality but every model do have some flaws. Its all plastic. At the same time, it has a lot of features that make it an amazing product and viable option.</p>
<p>The most exciting features in this keyboard are that you can customize the color combination to your taste. The keyboard do have macro keys, usb pass through and audio pass through. Its kinda expensive as compared to others but with low built quality. It is preferred to those gamers who value style with gaming.</p>

<h3>Last words on Razer Blackwidow Chroma</h3>
<div class="blueb">
<p>No doubt that Razer Chroma is one of  the finest Gaming keyboard out there.</p>
<p>Macro keys are available. Comfortable and programmable keys are there. The software is easy as compared to its competitor Corsair K70 RGB. It also has USB and Audio Pass-through.</p>
<p>The only thing I didn&#8217;t like in Razer chroma is it all plastic. What a shame! This keyboard is really expensive and yet comes with plastic body.</p>

<h2>4. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O4FGKLK/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Tesoro Excalibur G7NL</a> &#8211; Standard yet Strong</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-112" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Tesoro-Excalibur-G7NL-Review.jpg" alt="Tesoro Excalibur G7NL Review" width="800" height="300" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Tesoro-Excalibur-G7NL-Review.jpg 800w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Tesoro-Excalibur-G7NL-Review-300x113.jpg 300w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Tesoro-Excalibur-G7NL-Review-768x288.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Appearance or design is not Excalibur’s strong suite. You don’t get glossy finishes and flashy designs with this one. Its design can be described as standard at best. You would know why this happens to be one of the Best Gaming Keyboards 2016 list, after reading this review.</p>
<div class="su-tabs su-tabs-style-default my-custom-tabs" data-active="1"><div class="su-tabs-nav"><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Best Features</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Multiple Modes</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Reasonable for Gaming</span></div><div class="su-tabs-panes"><div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>Firstly, G7nl doesn’t have missed keys, thanks to N-Key rollover. Three switches are available- Red, Blue, and Brown. Its gaming grade mechanized keys account for 60 million key actuations. Rubberized bottom acting as anti-slip measure helps extreme gaming experience. It packs 512kB onboard macros memory.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>Three switches help a great deal in gaming and productivity. Three LED patterns prove valid for all types of activities.</p>
<p>It’s quite easy to change instantly between the modes too.</p>
<p>When you are a busybody who loves to multitask, you can’t thank this feature enough.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>If you rate on gaming experience alone, G7nl is just winning marginally. The switches hold excellent for intense tapping rate during gameplay. Gaming modes and macros keys do what is described. The option of switching between more than two LED modes should come handy.</div></div></div>
<h3>Few Hiccups in Design</h3>
<div class="redb">
<p>Adjusting G7nl on the desk can be quite challenging. The smaller legs, it uses for support folds back very quickly. For instance, when you move the keyboard forward or backward, they fold back undesirably. This adjustment issue could mean a distraction of few crucial seconds in gaming.</p>

<h3>Final Verdict</h3>
<div class="blueb">Tesoro Excalibur has the standard, but neatly constructed mechanical keyboard. It adds quite a few handy features such as macros, game mode, media keys and backlighting to a familiar layout. Without any doubt, you should make a purchase if you found it at a good price.</div>

<p>Individual backlighting would most probably be the first feature you would notice. Additional macros options are good, and it feels least intimidating even to the clumpy gamer. They have made it possible with the help of standard keyboard design.</p>

<p>It’s a mechanized keyboard fitted with Cherry MX mechanical switches. The design feels familiar with traditional ten button numeric pad. You got neat color options in Cherry MX, Red, Brown, Blue and more.</p>
<p>Though being minimalistic this design helps Quickfire to be one of the best keyboard available in the market.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>CM Storm has tried to open up to a lot of options in this keyboard. Nevertheless, low profile configuration makes this keyboard limited across parameters. For instance, you are allowed to use five-set layouts only.</p>
<p>This would mean the individual backlighting feature has gone missing. As relief, you can individually color arrow keys and WASD keys. Additionally, you can manually configure every single button. Such presets can be saved as profiles for future use.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>The first influential factor is it doesn’t require any software side efforts to save profiles. The 32 bit onboard ARM processor takes care of that.</p>
<p>It makes the keyboard readily portable across computers and laptops. CM has a reputation for building sturdy designs, and such toughness makes your investment worthy.</p>

<p>The CM Storm Quickfire Rapid-i is powerful and smaller mechanical gaming keyboard with a lot of interesting features. Most important thing is that you don&#8217;t require any extra software to use the keyboard like other gaming keyboards in our list.</p>

<p>Mechanized keys plus customized macros are what makes Orion Spark exclusive. The current keyboard would leave even the Logitech fans in surprise with all its unusual extras. From lighting to programmable features, you can tweak each and every technicality. This is the only Logitech’s device to be ranked in our Best Keyboards for gamers list.</p>

<p>The design is pretty standard like any other gaming keyboard. From full layout to mechanical switches to programmable macros, you have it all. G910 behaves highly traditional via its full QWERTY keyboard, built-in media controls, mode switches, ten key num pad, etc..</p>
<p>The keyboard only has a single USB port rather than a USB pass-through.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>Logitech gaming software is the default driver for keyboard plus its features. In G910, it also acts as the extensive customization suite, which helps to adjust color, lighting, and pattern. It also generates analytic on how each and every key is frequented.</p>
<p>The provided application can function for your keyboard as well as an additional Logitech mouse at the same time.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>Well shaped keycaps and its design favor gaming more, rather than typing. Touch typists may not appreciate the difference between keycaps on either side of the board.</p>

<h3>Final Words</h3>
<div class="blueb">Hardcore gamers can’t be more impressed with the degree of customization on offer. It’s an asymmetrical keyboard, so it doesn’t serve well outside gaming.

<p>Steelseries makes plenty of customization available to gamers. Along with the aesthetics, it serves well through serious technology. Some might call it ultimate choice amongst the best gaming keyboards 2016 though it’s too early to say it.</p>
<p>Ergonomic design isn’t the first factor that compels you to buy this model. The illumination is, in fact, its best feature. It offers a plethora of illumination combination through 16.8 million possible colors. You are free to define your custom lighting scheme. For instance, make a few keys red and few green in sync with progress in the game. You can turn off illumination for all keys except one.</p>
<p>Your imagination is the limit to the amount of permutations possible.</p>

<p>An LCD panel replacing standard number pad is the highlight of Razer Deathstalker Ultimate. The biggest complaint is it’s pricey. However, the expensive keyboard model can undo it all with revised pricing in the latter half of this year. Therefore, the Razer DeathStalker Ultimate is a serious contender for this list.</p>
<div class="redb"><strong>This keyboard is only for gamers. It really does suck when it comes to typing or doing any other job.</strong></div>

<p>The 4 inch LCD makes the track panel look crystal clear.</p>

Mad Catz fans love the brand for sturdy construction on all items of its catalog.</p>
<p>This keyboard feels solid when you pick it up. It doesn’t flex or bend much when put to the test. Heavy duty plastic matte adds more sturdiness to the intelligent design. Without showing signs of tear or scratches, it can take up some abuse.</p>
<p>The only minus is, the Kailh Brown switches doesn’t allow to mold keyboard according to your preferences.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>It’s a decent gaming keyboard which doesn’t lag much in typing capacity also.</p>
<p>It might produce a little delay in typing tasks, but it reduces error percentage by 25% at the same time. A solid gaming keyboard proving not so behind in typing prowess doesn’t happen frequently.</p>
<p>You can buy it for versatile usage.</div></div></div>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-157" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ROCCAT-RYOS-MK-Pro.jpg" alt="ROCCAT RYOS MK Pro Review" width="800" height="300" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ROCCAT-RYOS-MK-Pro.jpg 800w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ROCCAT-RYOS-MK-Pro-300x113.jpg 300w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ROCCAT-RYOS-MK-Pro-768x288.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>It falls into the affordable category, without too much of a unique design. The keyboard is intended to be the best budget gaming keyboard in the market. Nevertheless, this is by far best mechanical keyboard 2016 coming from RYOS series.</p>
<h3>Why Roccat Ryos MK Pro?</h3>
<p>Roccat Ryos MK Pro is the first mechanized keyboard coming from the reputed brand, Roccat. Availability of four key switch modes makes it a compelling buy. Individually backlit keys bolster the appearance overall.</p>
<p>Too many programmable options are present in this model. Built in USB and audio connections adds more value to an already excelling model.</p>

<p>The backlight cupboard seems almost empty, if not for the only option. Blue is your one and only choice for the backlight. Wrist rest is excessively bulky, making support feels awkward. To make matters worse, wrist rest cannot be removed.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>The best part about its design is the keyboard would feel too handy for professional as well as amateur gamers. The allowed limit for programmable keys is vast, thereby making customizations available for lightning quick gameplay.</p>
<p>The design would feel too similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006MO924S/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Roccat Isku</a>.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>The best feature to look for is the dozens of macro options. By default, you have eight micro keys to start with. In gameplay, the keyboard functions smoothly. The mechanical switches are quick and highly responsive.</p>

<h2>11. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N2ROG30/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Razer Orbweaver Gaming Keypad</a> &#8211; Worth a mention</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-158" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Razer-Orbweaver-Gaming-Keypad-Review.jpg" alt="Razer Orbweaver Gaming Keypad Review" width="800" height="300" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Razer-Orbweaver-Gaming-Keypad-Review.jpg 800w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Razer-Orbweaver-Gaming-Keypad-Review-300x113.jpg 300w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Razer-Orbweaver-Gaming-Keypad-Review-768x288.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>This is not a keyboard but worth a mention here in this top 10 gaming keyboards article. The device is called as gaming keypad, and that should tell the difference.</p>
<p>This is your mouse, keyboard, and joystick, all rolled in one.</p>
<h3>Gaming Keypads vs. Gaming Keyboards</h3>
<p>Keypads take it to a different level with one hand gaming action. One hand gaming translates to super-fast and convenient gaming. There aren’t any real limitations when you get used to keypads.</p>
<p>As a gamer, you can appreciate the different feel associated with gaming keypad rather a keyboard.</p>
<h3>Why Razer Orbweaver?</h3>
<p>Orbweaver showcases 30 fully programmable keys available for hotkeys, macros, etc…</p>
<p>An eight directional thumbpad that has a dual role in being modifiable key makes it so versatile. You can hardly find backlighting better than this elsewhere. The mechanical switches would mean excellent feedback, actuation and a vast array of reset points.</p>
<div class="su-tabs su-tabs-style-default my-custom-tabs" data-active="1"><div class="su-tabs-nav"><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Design &amp; Features</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Performance</span></div><div class="su-tabs-panes"><div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>Dimensions equate to 2.2 x 6.1 x 8.0 inches plus a 72 inch long USB cable.</p>
<p>It takes a lot less space on the desk than keyboards and other keypads. Higher palm rest in Orbweaver offers better support for gamers. You can make a million adjustments to three primary components – keypad encompassing 20 programmable buttons, two piece wrist rest, and thumb module.</p>
<p>The physical calibration is intended to cradle wrist and palm in a comfortable position.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>Even in heavy keyboard associated games, controls were smooth and intuitive. The absence of differentiation of WASD keys might pose a challenge to keyboard users. Actuation force in thumb buttons is just perfect with accidental clicks avoided.</p>
<p>Joystick feels to be positioned well since the thumb module can be repositioned entirely.</div></div></div>
<h3>Wrapping it up</h3>
<div class="blueb">When you switch to Razer Orbweaver, you are most likely making an irreversible change. Once you are used to it, controls must feel convenient than the standard keyboard. If you like it at first look, this should worth every penny spent.</div>
