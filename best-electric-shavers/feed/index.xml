		<description><![CDATA[Excellent review. What&#039;s amazing is how much these cost. I had one picked out then started looking at reviews. It was never mentioned. Are these considered high end. Or just really good ones that do the job right?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Best rotary shaver is the Norelco 8000 series. Sadly Norelco replaced it with 9000 series which isn&#039;t as good. The original RQ12 replacement head is also impossible to find and people charge hundreds for them because they know they are no longer in production and people want them. Norelco made a very bad decision.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This review is very dated. Norelco has the 9000 Series which launched in 2014 which replaced the 8000 Series (Sensotouch 3D). The 8000 Series is better in my opinion. I used both. Norelco has moved much of their production to China and are slipping pretty hard with overall quality and performance.
I have the Braun 7 Series also which I used before I got the Norelco 8000 Series. It is too loud and harsh on my face.
Best foil shaver is Panasonic Arc 5. This review on this site is TWO generations behind. There was one launched a few years ago that replaced it and another a few months ago that replaced that one. I tried the first two but not the most recent one.]]></description>
