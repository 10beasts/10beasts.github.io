		<description><![CDATA[The above Linksys WRT1900 AC says you can put DD-WRT on the router and this is true, but if you do it during the warranty period, it will void the warranty per Linksys tech. Also, I was told the warranty starts by date of manufacture and NOT the date of purchase (WTF, Right?) I have the WRT1200AC and it worked great for 5 months and now it crawls at very slow speed. I have gone through two levels of techs trying to fix it. There are blogs that say these Linksys routers do this a lot for everyone. You have to reboot them and re-flash firmware a lot to keep them working, like mine does. Also 2.4Ghz throughput is always way too slow.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Att calls pretty much all their internet offerings U-verse from crap dsl to their gigafiber.

Which router greatly depends on which service you are getting. Even after that att has a lot of their systems rigged so you can not replace their router. Not 100% sure why but in some cases it is related to their cable tv boxes being dependent on their router.

You will have to investigate which plans and what options you have. In general the routers provided by ISP will run at the speeds they have committed to in their contracts so a different router will not be faster. Some have poor wireless coverage but most are similar in performance to any other router you will buy. Mostly you would want to replace the router for some feature like VPN or NAS or something else the router does not have. 

You can check out our top of the list Asus RT-AC88U a dual-band router that can act as a NAS as well. The router is priced under $300 and it happens to be one of the best wireless routers one can buy right now. You can check the detailed review in our guide. Hope it helps :)
