<h3>Why the Latest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B015PD3HOC/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Netgear R8500</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0167HG1V6/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ASUS AC5300</a> are not on my list?</h3>
<hr />
<p>Lots of people wondering that why I didn&#8217;t include the <strong>latest AC5300</strong> models from Netgear and Asus in my Top 10 list? Well, the answer is simple.</p>
<div class="su-list su-list-style-">
<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> These latest routers are extremely expensive.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> To be honest they don&#8217;t deliver any better experience compared to the cheaper routers out the in the market.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> Currently, there are no clients which can take advantage of the latest speed standard (AC5300).</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> Mobile Apps are buggy.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in simple words, you are paying for the latest speed standard AC5300 and there are no computer system or client which can handle it. Isn&#8217;t it a waste of money?</p>
<p>For now, these routers are useless.</p>
<p>However, we believe in the middle of 2017 (July), the clients which can utilize this latest tech will be available. So, I hope both of these routers will make it to the top of our <strong>Best Wireless Routers 2017</strong> List.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B016EWKQAQ/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-307 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Asus-RT-AC88U-Review.jpg" alt="Asus RT-AC88U Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>Most of the computer enthusiasts or users know Asus because of their top of the line gaming hardware. However, for those who don¡¯t know, Asus is also at the helm for creating several high ends, top of the line routers. The offer we are going to talk about today is known as the RT-AC88U, the router is priced under $300 and it happens to be one of the best wireless routers one can buy right now.</p>
<p>The wireless router offers a stylish sleek look, something that people will find familiar, especially if they have used an Asus product in the past. The router is aesthetically pleasing with its complete black construction with red accents along the antennas, it looks straight out of a gaming lineup by Asus.</p>
<div class="redb">However, most of you are not here for the looks and are more interested in the performance, so without wasting any more time, let¡¯s take a look at how the router performs.</div>
<p>The RT-AC88U is an AC3100 router which comes with a total of 8 Gigabit LAN ports, do keep in mind that these ports are capable of delivering high-speed internet without suffering from any performance issues, and not to forget that it is a dual-band router that can act as a NAS as well. With that said, Asus as paid a significant amount of attention to detail even when designing the web interface as it happens to be super intuitive and easy to use. The WiFi performance of the router on both 2.4 gigahertz and the 5 gigahertz bands stayed faster than ever without any performance decreases.</p>
<h3>Installation, Configuration, and Performance</h3>
<p>The installation process of RT-AC88U is a piece of cake, thanks to the amazing web interface. When you connect it to the PC and internet for the first time and power on the PC, the Asus Web Interface will automatically launch and give you two options to configure the router. Either you can continue with the wizard or you can configure it manually.</p>
<p>The Quick Internet Setup wizard, will check your internet connection and configure your router as a Dynamic IP, Static IP or PPPoE, depends on your connection type selection. After that, it allows you to set a name for each SSID, and then create a network encryption key for each band. After that, it&#8217;s all done.</p>
<p>When it comes to performance, the Asus RT-AC88U provides multi-client MU-MIMO data streaming, works extremely fast on both bands (2.4 Gigahertz and 5 Gigahertz) and File reading/writing and transfers were great.</p>
<div id="visualizer-1099-1973218924" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-1099"></div>
<div class="blueb">In short, the router is perfect if you are willing to spend money on it, it can be coined as ¡°you get what you pay for¡±.</div>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F0DD0I6/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-314 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-R7000-Review.jpg" alt="NETGEAR Nighthawk R7000 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next up is another dual-band router, but this time, the offering is being done by none other than <a href="http://www.netgear.com/home/products/networking/wifi-routers/">the famous Netgear</a>. For those who don¡¯t know, the company is famous for creating a plethora of top of the line wireless routers that have become increasingly famous overtime. Netgear is a company that has dedicated itself towards providing top of the line, unparalleled networking hardware including their brilliant wireless routers.</p>
<p>The product that we are bringing you today is called the Netgear Nighthawk R7000, and as the name suggests, the router looks nothing less of a stealth fighter jet. The Nighthawk R7000 is AC1900 with 1,300 Mbps speed in the 5 gigahertz band and a 600 Mbps speed on the 2.4 gigahertz band.</p>
<p><strong>I like R7000 more than R8000 because it is affordable and much more easy to install.<br />
During our testing, it was revealed that the R7000 just might be the best Netgear wireless router we have used till date. Curious yet? Let¡¯s find out.</strong></p>
<div class="su-tabs su-tabs-style-default my-custom-tabs" data-active="1"><div class="su-tabs-nav"><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Design</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Performance</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Features</span></div><div class="su-tabs-panes"><div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">From the looks of it, the router looks amazing, it has the minimal, stealthy vibe to it, the router has an all-black construction and comes with 3 detachable antennas. Our only issue on the design front was the weight and the size of the Nighthawk; in all seriousness, the router is an absolute mammoth and needs quite some free space to be put with ease, not to mention the extra bulk it comes with.</p>
<p>However, we found that issue to be subjective as it happens that you will only need to make space for the router once, and won¡¯t be moving it a lot afterward.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">The Netgear Nighthawk offers a stellar performance, as a matter of fact, it is one of the fastest routers we have used till date. The performance on both 5 gigahertz and the 2.4 gigahertz bands is impeccable and didn¡¯t face any hiccups or slowdowns during the entire testing process.</p>
<p>The WiFi router also manages to perform really well on different ranges, and the bands manage to give you performance that is better than the performance was given by your usual Ethernet connection.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">Moving on to the features, the Nighthawk AC1900 is packed with them, if you are wondering what you¡¯ll be getting, you should know that this router comes with the support for DD-WRT, this means that the router is fully capable of running 3<sup>rd</sup> party firmware based on Linux.</p>
<p>The router also comes with the support for OpenVPN and thanks to the OpenDNS, there is a complete parental control package built into the router.</p>
<p>The router even comes with QoS (Quality of Service) for those who don¡¯t know, this is a feature can let you manage the upstream and downstream of your internet connection. Pretty cool, we¡¯d say. If you want more, the router can also act as a NAS and a pretty good one, actually.</div></div></div>
<div id="visualizer-1098-1765612654" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-1098"></div>
<div class="blueb">Overall, the Netgear Nighthawk AC1900 is an impressive router that offers a lot for the price you are paying for it. Sure, it¡¯s bulky and has some performance issues on the 2.4 gigahertz band. But considering the price to performance ratio, the Nighthawk AC1900 is perhaps one of the best routers you can buy in the market right now.</div>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PVD81MK/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-326 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/D-Link-DIR-890l-Review.jpg" alt="D-Link DIR-890l Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next up on our list is one of the top tier wireless routers from D-Link, for those who don¡¯t know, the company has a long history of providing some of the best networking products and the <strong>AC3200 Ultra Wi-Fi DIR-890</strong> isn¡¯t here to tell a different story. As a matter of fact, it is perhaps one of the most stylish looking wireless routers we have encountered. Where the Nighthawk resembled a stealth jet, the DIR-890 looks like it was built by race car enthusiasts. But looks aren¡¯t everything, right? Let¡¯s find out how this router fairs in things that actually matter.</p>
<p><strong>The DIR-890 is an amazing router in terms of speed and functionality.</strong></p>
<p>Testing revealed that the router is fast, easy to setup and use, and has a good speed/range when using for the purpose of Wi-Fi. Another great thing about this router is that it comes with the ability to be doubled up as a NAS by adding an external hard drive.</p>
<div class="redb">Do keep in mind that the DIR-890 is a tri-band router, and if you happen to be a general consumer who just wants a router for normal use, then this one will be an overkill for you.</div>
<div class="su-tabs su-tabs-style-default my-custom-tabs" data-active="1"><div class="su-tabs-nav"><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Design</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Range</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">LAN Ports</span></div><div class="su-tabs-panes"><div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">We have already discussed how the design of this router ends up making a statement of its own, and that¡¯s quite right. The router has an overall red build with black accents. The router easily manages to stand out and if you have a computer that follows the red/black color scheme, this is something you must have. Enough about the looks, let¡¯s talk about the things matter.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">If you happen to live at a comparatively large place and have a lot of Wi-Fi devices that consistently need to be connected to the internet, this one is a must&#8217;ve for you. Although it does come with six antennas and promises proper range, if you happen to have issues with antennas, you¡¯d be sad to know that they can¡¯t be detached.</p>
<p><strong>During the testing, the range seemed promising enough.</strong></div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">If you want more LAN ports, the DIR-890 is not something you want, the router only comes with 4 LAN ports as opposed to some routers that have 8 LAN ports. With that said, if you can overlook that limitation, then the DIR-890L is a stellar router.</div></div></div>
<div id="visualizer-1100-2013547921" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-1100"></div>
<div class="blueb">Whether you love the unique and sharp design of the router, or a number of features it comes with; the DIR-890 by D-Link is perhaps one of the best routers on the market that prefer style over substance but manages to give you a respectable performance.</div>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KWHMR6G/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-320 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Netgear-Nighthawk-R800-Review.jpg" alt="Netgear Nighthawk R8000 X6 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>If you liked the Netgear Nighthawk R7000 but thought that you want something better (But Expensive), then the Nighthawk AC3200 is just what you are looking for.</p>
<p>Though do keep in mind that R8000 is a compliant, tri-band router, it is quite expensive, but don¡¯t worry, the router comes with enough features that will make you ignore the price point and get it anyway.</p>
<p>The Nighthawk AC3200, although has a similar color scheme of its younger sibling, it features a redesign, it is comparatively larger in footprint, however, it happens to be much more compact when compared to the older version; the compactness is because of six antennas that can be collapsed with great ease. With that said, the router still looks epic as far as the aesthetics go.</p>
<div class="redb">Speaking of performance, the Nighthawk AC3200 manages to give the same stellar performance as its younger sibling did. A lot of people might think that it¡¯s a waste of money in that case, but like the saying goes,<strong> ¡°if it ain¡¯t broke, don¡¯t fix it¡±</strong>, with that said, seems like Netgear did the exact same thing.</div>
<p>Although it is a wireless router, it can be doubled up as a NAS if you attach an external hard drive with it. Luckily, unlike many other routers, the NAS performance on this one is actually quite good for the price you are paying for it. The router manages to give incredible speeds over the 5 gigahertz band; speeds on the lesser 2.4 gigahertz band is good enough, but not something to write home about</p>
<div id="visualizer-1097-880927935" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-1097"></div>
<div class="blueb">The Netgear R8000 Nighthawk X6 AC3200 is an impressive wireless router whose shortcomings make it a bit of a hard decision to purchase. If you are looking for something that gives you amazing performance over the 5 gigahertz band and has a stellar performance as a NAS, then this router should be your pick. It is not wrong to call it the <strong>Best Gaming Router 2017</strong>.</div>

<p>If you are looking for a router that has a classy, aggressive design and is packed with features. The Asus RT-AC3200 is a win-win deal.</p>
<p>As you can tell, this is a tri-band router with a hefty price tag, but you should keep in mind that a number of features that are packed into this router alone are enough to justify the heavy price tag it comes with. With that said, if you are willing to spend your money on a router that will give you extremely good performance and a plethora of features that are a dream come true for a networking enthusiast, then check out all the details about the RT-AC3200 by Asus.</p>
<div class="su-tabs su-tabs-style-default my-custom-tabs" data-active="1"><div class="su-tabs-nav"><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Design</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Features</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">OpenVPN and NAS</span></div><div class="su-tabs-panes"><div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">The router looks quite similar to what you would expect from Asus, it sports 6 antennas that can be detachable and replaced by more capable ones, and even though the design alone can make a statement, it isn¡¯t something that would be the selling point for this wonderful router. You should keep in mind that the router looks absolutely stunning, although a little bulky, the looks alone can make on fall in love with this.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">The RT-AC3200 is something that is built for network enthusiasts who enjoy the top-tier hardware, the router happens to be incredibly fast in almost all the tests we have done on it, and has a really good performance over Wi-Fi, with respectable range.</p>
<p>The router also has an incredible web interface that makes it easy to setup, however, newcomers should know that the extensive list of features might confuse them a bit.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">Last but not the least, another great thing about this router is that it can double up as an OpenVPN server or act as a NAS (Network Attached Storage) and you should be glad to know that it does a really good job at both.</div></div></div>
<div class="redb">Sadly, the router is a bit lacking on the LAN ports as it only happens to have 4 of them, but if you are at a place where not many devices are connected with Ethernet cables, then it shouldn¡¯t be an issue.</div>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<div class="blueb">Overall, the Asus RT-AC3200 is an overkill for a normal consumer, however, at the same time, it¡¯s a dream come true for any networking lover. The router is powerful, looks good, and has plenty of features that will have you coming back for more. With that said, if you¡¯re not heavily interested in the AC3200 capabilities of this router, you can always go for a cheaper AC1900. Anyhow, the Asus RT-AC3200 is an amazing router that will serve you for a long time.</div>

<p>The next up on our list is the Amped Wireless RTA2600 Athena router, and as long as you don¡¯t confuse it with the Greek goddess Athena, the router will not disappoint you. Although not that much expensive, the router is something that is built for the network enthusiasts, it might not have the bling of the other routers that we have reviewed, but it comes with plenty of features that should be enough for both the average consumer and people who are looking to have some more.</p>
<p>The router managed to fair pretty well in almost all the testing we did, although the router doesn¡¯t have an awful lot of features like some of the other ones, but the ones it has are properly polished and don¡¯t require you to spend countless hours trying to figure out what is what. The router control panel is incredibly responsive, and very easy when it comes to setting up.</p>
<p>The router also comes with powerful hardware that should keep it afloat without giving any performance issues. One thing we really love about this router is how nicely everything is packed in a compact design. Yes, unlike some other routers, this isn¡¯t an absolute behemoth. With that said, the performance on all fronts was respectable enough, and there were no disconnections or whatsoever during our test run. You can even connect multiple devices via Wi-Fi and the performance will still remain stellar, perhaps that is one of the major selling points of the RTA2600 Athena.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<div class="blueb">The wireless router is easily one of the best we have used and definitely makes it to the best wifi routers 2017 list. With that said, this might not be the number one pick for hardcore network enthusiasts but it is more than enough to keep things in order without making too much of a mess.</div>

<p>The next up on our list is a dual-band wireless router from Linksys, the router comes with the support for the AC1900 standard support; this means that the 5 gigahertz band has a speed of 1,300 megahertz and the 2.5 gigahertz band has a speed of 600 megahertz. But is this router capable enough of holding against most of the top tier routers that we have already listed? Let¡¯s find out.</p>
<p>As soon as you will set your eyes on this router, you will be reminded of the classic design and color scheme that has been gracing the routers from Linksys for quite some time. With that said, if you are thinking about putting this router on a work desk that is already crammed up, you should know that you are going to need to clear some space as this is probably one of the largest routers we have seen in a long time.</p>
<p>The router has four antennas and the firmware it ships with can be replaced by a completely custom firmware if the user is willing to. As soon as you take the router out of the box, you will experience that the router happens to be one of the fastest routers available in the market, it¡¯s easy to set up and loaded with features. With that said, Linksys was kind enough to add a complete capability of doubling up this router as a NAS, however, that¡¯s not the greatest thing, the greatest thing about this router is that the NAS performance is definitely unsurpassed when compared to all the other wireless routers we have been testing. Not to forget that it also supports <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5803975/what-is-upnp-and-how-do-i-use-it-to-stream-media-to-my-tv">UPnP (Universal Plug and Play)</a> and DLNA. Last but not the least, the performance on both bands is amazing, and the router performs without any hiccups.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even the Experts are in love with this wireless router. You can read the article by <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2457009,00.asp">Samara Lynn on PCMag</a>. It is rated as Excellent and given 4.5 Rating.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<div class="blueb">So is this router perfect? Apart from some minor subjective flaws like a huge, bulky designs, there isn¡¯t much to write bad about. The router emerged victorious in almost all the testing we have done and managed to perform without crashing on us. The software experience might confuse those who are not experts and at the same time, might be lacking for network enthusiasts. With that said, if you have the money, and you¡¯re looking for a capable router, this one¡¯s your best bet.</div>

<p>TP-LINK Archer C7 AC1750 is the best budget wifi router out there <strong>(Under $100).</strong></p>
<p>The router is perfect for people who want to enjoy internet gaming as well as streaming, thanks to the fact that this router has a combined speed of 1.75 Gbps.</p>
<p>With that said, the router is both stylish and incredible at every task thrown at it, and for those who are looking for the perfect price and performance ratio, the router is an amazing choice.</p>
<div class="redb">Considering how it is an entry level router, the build quality isn¡¯t all that good and the router seems flimsy, with that said, make sure that you don¡¯t end up dropping the router because it can, and will probably get damaged. And even though the build quality seems to be average at best, the router has a large footprint, so make sure that where you place the router, it has enough space for itself.</div>
<p>Moving on to the thing that matter, keep in mind that it happens to be a dual-band router; the router has a total of 6 antennas, 3 of them are external while the remaining 3 are internal. The increased number of antennas are really good for giving you a respectable amount of Wi-Fi range and the speed also happens to be respectable enough. The router also comes with NAS capability, but don¡¯t get too excited as it is only average.</p>
<div id="visualizer-1096-578881517" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-1096"></div>
<div class="blueb">What¡¯s lacking is that despite the price you are going to pay for the router, you won¡¯t be getting an awful lot of features. But then again, TP-Link aimed this router towards the entry level and budget oriented consumers who just want to have a good wireless router with decent enough performance when it comes to streaming and online gaming with great ease.</div>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J8NCVX4/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-324 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/D-Link-DIR-880L-Review.jpg" alt="D-Link DIR-880L Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>Let¡¯s just consider it a younger, yet excellent sibling of the DIR-890 that we reviewed earlier. There are quite some changes when compared to the DIR-890, for instance, this one happens to be a dual band router. But is it even worthy? As a matter of fact, according to our testing, this router manages to outperform the much expensive elder brother and has a lot of refined features that are both easy to use and come without a hassle. So how much difference there is between both routers from D-Link? Let¡¯s find out.</p>
<p>The router has the same design you would expect from a D-Link router, if you are concerned about having detachable antennas, then don¡¯t worry. All the antennas can easily be detached, and replaced with ones that will provide you higher Wi-Fi range. With that said, thanks to the detachable antennas, the router is actually very compact. Another great feature about this router is that it can be remotely managed via the cloud service that is being provided by D-Link, and although it may seem like a gimmick to some, it is actually a very useful feature, especially if you are in a different room than the router itself.</p>
<p>With that said, the parts that represent the performance are actually really amazing. Testing revealed that this is perhaps a good router, the performance on both bands was amazing, and the Wi-Fi range managed to impress us. As for the transfer rates, they managed to be perfect, and we didn¡¯t find any sort of disconnection or slow speeds.</p>
<div class="redb">The only downside of this router is that the web interface is a bit of a surprise for both the newcomers and people who have been using D-Link routers for a long time.</div>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<div class="blueb">At this point, it would be safe to conclude that perhaps one of the best router on the list and definitely one of the best wireless routers is the DIR-880L by D-Link. It happens to prefer both style and substance, and doesn¡¯t sacrifice one for the other.</div>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DB9WCR6/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-325 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Apple-AirPort-Extreme-ME918LLA-Review.jpg" alt="Apple AirPort Extreme ME918LL Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The last in our list is all the way from Apple.</p>
<p>For those who are wondering if this router made it here by accident, then don¡¯t. Apple has a wireless router, and it¡¯s pretty good. The router is unconventionally named AirPort Extreme Base Station. So, how does this router fair against other routers in the list? Well, let¡¯s find out, shall we?</p>
<p>Let¡¯s start off by how this router looks. Why? Because obviously, this is something coming out of Apple¡¯s very own helm, and you should know that the router looks exactly like something that will be made by Apple. With that said, and looks apart, the router is actually very capable and performs really well. Do keep in mind that it is a dual band router and supports the latest Wi-Fi standards as well. The router is incredibly fast in all the tests thrown at it, another great thing about this router is the amount of Wi-Fi stability and speed it provides. To be very honest, Apple truly outdid themselves with this router as it has everything on the right spot.</p>
<p>As for the downsides of this router, there aren¡¯t any that will make you reconsider your decision of buying this router. The only complaint we have is that the router could have been a proper upgrade over its predecessors, but it wasn¡¯t, and although it is quite fast and amazing, the upgrades seemed subjective.</p>
<h3>Final Verdict</h3>
<div class="blueb">Finally, the router is probably one of the best routers from Apple till date, it offers fast and stable performance and doesn¡¯t create any issues.</div>

<h2>Wireless Router Buyer&#8217;s Guide</h2>
<div class="redb">If you keep the aforementioned points in mind, you can easily go out to the market and buy a wireless router, right? <strong>Hell No!</strong></div>
<p>For those who don¡¯t know, wireless routers come with several things you need to consider before you actually spend the hard earned money. They have different available speeds as well as different WiFi standards and support for multiple bands.</p>
<h2>The technology behind a wireless Router?</h2>
<p>Every wireless router basically consists of three major points, the router itself, a network switch and a wireless access point.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>router</strong> basically serves the purpose of managing and directing traffic to the different devices connected to your network, in simpler terms, a router is responsible for sending data from your network to the other networks out there.</li>
<li>As for the <strong>network switch</strong>, the purpose of a network switch is to connect all your devices that are running WiFi to other wired devices using Ethernet cables.</li>
<li>Lastly, a <strong>wireless access point</strong> is just a simple station that has an antenna and the only job of a wireless access point is to transmit and receive wireless signals.</li>
</ul>

<p>To make things easier for you below is the list of &#8220;<strong>wireless routers type</strong>&#8221; you will encounter in the market along with their brief descriptions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dual Band Routers:</strong> Perhaps the most common type of routers are dual band routers, if you are wondering why they got such a name, it¡¯s because these routers operate on 2 different frequencies; 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz. They also happen to be the cheapest type of wireless routers available.</li>
<li><strong>Tri-Band Routers:</strong> These routers are comparatively newer in the market and offer three bands; two of the bands are 5 gigahertz and one happens to be the 2.4 gigahertz band. Considering how these routers are still new in the market, they are consistently introducing new and new technologies with the passage of time.</li>
<li><strong>N600 Routers:</strong> For those who don¡¯t know, the N600 routers are the routers that have a combined speed of 600 Mbps; the speed is then evenly split between the 2.4 gigahertz and the 5 gigahertz band. They are comparatively old but are known to get the job done. However, they aren¡¯t suggested for the modern high-speed internet.</li>
<li><strong>N900 Routers:</strong> These routers are the upgraded versions of the N600 routers, these routers have a combined speed of 900 Mbps that is evenly divided between the 2.4 and the 5 gigahertz bands.</li>
</ul>
<div class="su-tabs su-tabs-style-default my-custom-tabs" data-active="1"><div class="su-tabs-nav"><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">AC1750 Routers</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">AC1900 Routers</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">AC3200 Routers</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">AC5300 Routers</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">DD-WRT Routers</span></div><div class="su-tabs-panes"><div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">Compared to the previously mentioned routers, these offer a combined high speed of 1750 Mbps, however, the speed of these routers isn¡¯t evenly split. The 2.4 gigahertz band gets a speed of 450 Mbps, and the 5 gigahertz band gets the remaining 1,300 Mbps speed.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">When compared to the AC1750 routers, these are quite similar, however, they offer a higher speed of 600 Mbps the 2.4 gigahertz, and the same 1,300 Mbps speed on the 5 gigahertz band.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">These routers start drifting towards the tri-band territory; they have a combined speed of 3,200 Mbps, 2,600 Mbps is evenly split between the two 5 gigahertz bands, and the remaining 600 Mbps is dedicated to the 2.4 gigahertz band.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">Perhaps the latest offering in the market is the AC5300 routers; these routers have a combined speed of 5,300 Mbps or 5.3 Gbps. The speed alone makes them the fastest and the most expensive routers that are currently available in the market.</p>
<p>However, there are no Clients (PCs, Laptops, Mobile Devices) available in the market which can support that much speed. So we can say  that AC5300 is offering a speed which is useless for now.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">These routers are comparatively different than the ones we have mentioned before. As compared to all the other wireless routers, the DD-WRT compliant routers use a Linux based third party firmware and has a lot of features that are missing from the ordinary routers. DD-WRT routers are basically like phones that are rooted or phones that are jailbroken.</div></div></div>
<p>With said, there are limitless options available when it comes to finding the wireless routers in today¡¯s day and age, the market is quite saturated and every manufacturer is trying their best to bring up the best possible router there for consumers to enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Here I&#8217;m also going to include some FAQs about Wireless Routers.</strong></p>
<div class="su-accordion">
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>A wireless Router is a mundane device?</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">From the looks of it, a wireless router is a rather mundane device, and even though it may have some looks to it, the overall concept will be boring to people who have no interest in knowing how these things work.</div></div>
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>What is the biggest advantage?</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">However, if you happen to be a networking enthusiast like me, a wireless router can mean a great thing to you.</p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of a wifi router is that they can connect your internet with a number of different devices, and all of that without the need of a modem. If you are wondering which devices you can connect, almost all of the devices that have a WiFi chip inside them can be connected to the internet via a wireless router.</div></div>
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Why people buy cheap routers?</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">A lot of people live on the theory that a good wireless router isn¡¯t something they need, in such case, they prefer to stick to a $50 router and denies that a more expensive router is basically just shedding some extra money.</div></div>
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Why you need to buy Modern and Advanced Wi-fi router?</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">The actual story is different.</p>
<p>When you are in the market to purchase a wireless router, there are a lot of things you should keep in mind, you should know that a better, more expensive wireless router will always be ahead of a cheaper one in almost every task you throw at it. Be it playing games over the internet, streaming videos, or making Skype calls. An expensive wireless router will do these jobs better than the cheaper one.</p>
<p><strong>Do keep in mind that your network speed must also be good in order for things to work properly.</strong></div></div></div>
<h2>Advantages and Functionalities of Modern and Advanced Wifi Routers</h2>

<ul>
<li>Most modern wireless routers have the ability to provide you with a unique IP address for all the devices you connect to the internet, since how the IP address is unique and not available to public; your network will not be prone to get hacked.</li>
<li>A good wireless router will always be easy to set up with features that are easy to understand and intuitive. A good wireless router will also make sure that the use of cables is as less as possible in order to stay true to its legacy.</li>
<li>For people who are into <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">NAS (Network Attached Storage)</a></strong> many flagship wireless routers come with the support for external hard drive, this means that you can easily plug in your external hard drive to the port that is available on the wireless router.</li>
<li>Most of the top of the line wireless routers come with the support of <strong>DLNA</strong>, for those who don¡¯t know, DLNA is basically a technology that you can use to have a proper control over how audio, video, and media is handled over the network you are using.</li>
<li>Last but not the least, most high-end routers also come with some additional advantages like the prioritization of networks, the ability to do shared printing over the USB, parental control as well backup servers for important data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although it¡¯s not something a majority of people don¡¯t know about, a lot of people usually miss out important information simply because they don¡¯t pay attention or it doesn¡¯t concern them.</p>
<p>In simpler words, the windshield wipers are basically the wipers that are installed on the windshield of a vehicle.</p>
<p>We use the word <strong>&#8220;Vehicle&#8221;</strong> because these wipers install on a lot of vehicles rather than just on cars. These wipers are there to make sure that whenever you are driving out and there¡¯s rain or snowfall outside, you will be able to clear it from your windshield in order to make sure that your view isn¡¯t obstructed somehow.</p>
<div class="redb">
<p>Believe it or not, driving a vehicle without a windshield wiper is dangerous to a point that it¡¯s actually prohibited in a lot of states, and anyone who¡¯s still driving a vehicle without the wipers can be fined.</p>
<p><strong>That is why I highly recommend you to read the buyer&#8217;s guide at the end of the article.</strong></p>

<h2>1. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JU5W54/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="first">Bosch 26A ICON</a> &#8211; Best Wiper Blades to get right now</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JU5W54/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1303 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Bosch-ICON-Review.jpg" alt="Bosch ICON Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>Bosch is a company that has participated in the manufacturing of a lot of amazing products.</p>
<p>So, when we first heard that they make wiper blades for vehicles too, we were generally excited to check those out because why not.</p>
<p>The model we are taking a look at today is known as the 26A ICON; now do keep in mind that the number in the model number is basically the size of the wiper blade; so this one is 26 inch, although, Bosch is offering the same amazing wiper blade in multiple sizes.</p>
<div class="yb">For those wondering about the sizes that are available, the Bosch Icon comes in 13¡± to 24¡± and 26¡± Needless to say, Bosch has made sure that they are offering the wiper blades in the majority of sizes.</div>
<p>Now when it comes to choosing a specific wiper blade, people need some convincing mainly because there¡¯s always a cheaper option available. The reason you should buy this wiper blade is rather simple, this one actually comes with some of the best features that we are going to discuss right now.</p>
<p>According to official statement from Bosch, the Icon wiper blade comes with dual rubber lining that prevents a lot of the issues that are normally found in other windshield wipers; for starters, the Bosh 26A Icon, as well as all the other Bosh windshield wipers, are made out of FX dual rubber, ensuring that you won¡¯t hear any chattering noises. This also ends up increasing the lifespan for about 40 percent.</p>
<div class="redb">While at first, we thought that this is a gimmick, but upon proper testing, we realized that it¡¯s actually not, and the 26A Icon is actually that good. The wiper also comes with a bracketless design, and while it may raise some concerns for some people, it¡¯s actually really good because having this sort of design prevents the snow or ice from building up.</div>
<p>The wiper blades are also equipped with dual steel springs, ensuring that a proper, uniform force is applied across the entire wiper blade. While this may sound like a gimmick to some, it¡¯s actually very useful as it increases the overall lifespan of the wiper blade.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, we also realized that the wiper happens to be very, very quiet during the operation, something that is very useful for people who don¡¯t like the additional noise that most wipers are known for creating.</p>
<p>Overall, there¡¯s no denying that the Bosch Icon series of wipers is amazing; sure, it can be a bit on the expensive side, but by spending all this money, you¡¯re getting some really great wiper blades that will complement your vehicle and clean the windshield a lot better than the stock one.</p>

<p>The next windshield wiper blade we¡¯re looking at is known as the Rain-X Latitude; now this is perhaps one of the most famous wiper blades that are available in the market, and that¡¯s because the company pays some special attention into the creation of these wiper blades.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring that your vehicle is using the best possible windshield wiper blades.</strong></p>
<p>With that said, the Rain-x Latitude is made out of quality material, and in case you are trying to find out the material used in this specific windshield wiper, then you should know that these are made out of synthetic rubber.</p>
<p>Now much like the best windshield wiper blades out in the market, this one also come in multiple sizes, so that makes sure that even if your vehicle uses a different size than the rest, you don¡¯t have any troubles finding the compatible windshield wiper.</p>
<div class="yb">The really good thing about this wiper is that there are absolutely no exposed metal parts, and while this may not make sense to some, the good thing here is that this means there will be absolutely no ice, or snow build up inside the parts. This is something of a very common issue that a majority of windshield wipers are actually suffering from this issue, but now the Rain-X Latitude.</div>
<p>Another great thing about this particular windshield wiper blade is that it comes with a pre-installed small j-hook that you can use to attach the wiper with, however, if your vehicle uses some other type of attachment, the wiper blade also comes with multiple attachments that you can use to actually attach the wiper blade without really running into any issues.</p>
<p>Overall, the Rain-X Latitude is perhaps one of the best windshield wipers that are available in the market at the time of writing, the material is durable, the wiper is easy to install, and there is a very good operational flow that provides a smooth, noise free experience.</p>

<p>Most people don¡¯t really realize the importance of the windshield blades until they end up losing the one that has been doing all the work on their vehicle¡¯s windshield, and they are forced to install a new one.

<p>We are now taking a look at a really amazing windshield wiper blade from a company known as Valeo, now for those who don¡¯t know, Valeo is basically a company known for creating some of the finest windshield blades that are available in the market, however, a lot of people often overlook the company¡¯s brilliant range of windshield wipers that are available to the consumers.</p>

In addition to that, these windshield wiper blades are cleverly designed with integrated spoilers to ensure maximum integrity.</p>
<p>In addition to that, Valeo has made sure that these windshield wipers don¡¯t have any exposed metal parts because that will just make the windshield wipers prone to collecting, ice, snow, or dust.

<p>When it comes to new wiper blades, a lot of people prefer OEM blades because they believe that the quality is always better, and while that¡¯s not always the truest of things, it can be true if you¡¯re comparing some really bad ones to the OEM ones.</p>
<p>For those who don¡¯t know, OEM basically means ¡°original equipment manufacturer¡±, and in this case, OEM level wiper blades basically mean that your car¡¯s manufacturer manufactured the wiper blades as well.</p>
<p>Today, we are looking at Aero OEM Premium wiper blades for a variety of vehicles, now for those who don¡¯t know, Aero is one of the OEM companies that create some of the best wiper blades for different vehicle manufacturers.</p>
<p>The Aero OEM Premium wiper blades are made out of specially blended rubber that stands really well against all the hard work that gets done by the wipers, the wipers are designed with aerodynamics in mind, and for those who don¡¯t know, this means that during the usage, there will be comparatively lesser drag, and at the same time lesser amount of noise that will be introduced.</p>
<p>In addition to that, in order to make sure there¡¯s no dust, ice, or snow stuck to the inside of the wiper, the company has designed these wipers without any exposed metal parts, this means that your whole experience will go a lot smoother.</p>

<p>Yes, Valeo 900 series has already been loved and reviewed by us, and we thought that we should take a look at the Valeo 600 series now.</p>
<p>To be honest, not much from the Valeo 900 series has changed, and it is a good thing because a lot of people don¡¯t like change when it¡¯s not positive. So, while most people think that the Valeo 600 series is basically a downgrade, it¡¯s simply not.</p>

<div class="redb">Not to forget, the Valeo 600 series windshield wipers are constructed using galvanized steel, and while galvanized steel is a bit too strong, and the actual applications are a lot different, the reason why galvanized steel is used here is because galvanized steel because that will make it resistant to a lot of issues like corrosion and other known issues as well.</div>
<p>Overall, for anyone who wants somewhat similar looks from the Valeo 900 series, the Valeo 600 series is perhaps one of the best one that is available in the market. Sure, you may think that you are compromising on the quality, but in all honesty, there isn¡¯t anything that feels downgraded with the Valeo 600 series at all.<div class="su-row">

<h2>7. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005WTPC2A/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="seven">Trico Force</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005WTPC2A/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1309 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Trico-Force-Review.jpg" alt="Trico Force Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>We are closing in on our list, and we still have some of the best windshield wipers that we are planning on looking at. Right now, we are looking at this amazing wiper blade that is aptly named Trico Force. Now unlike some of the previous wiper blades that we have reviewed so far, the name doesn¡¯t really represent anything, and while the indecisive nature may make some people raise their eyebrows, it shouldn¡¯t be enough for others to judge these wiper blades unfairly.</p>
<p>Now the good thing here is that these wiper blades are available in a variety of different sizes, so even if you happen to have a vehicle with a different windshield than the conventional design, you should be at ease knowing that you won¡¯t be running into issues such as compatibility or improper finishing.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering about the type of material that is used in the manufacturing of these windshield wipers, you should know that these are made out of HighGlide Treated Rubber, and the reason why this rubber proves to be really good is because it allows the windshield blade to easily glide and slide on the windshield without really causing a lot of drag, or creating unpleasant noise.</p>
<p>The entire wiper is made out of high-quality material and doesn¡¯t leave out any of the structure exposed, meaning that nothing can get stuck inside the structure and cause issues. This is something that we see a lot in most high-end wiper blades that are largely available in the market.</p>
<p>The wiper uses an amazing method of attachment that minimizes the amount of effort that it may take and maximizes the priority, making sure that you don¡¯t have a hard time installing these wipers onto your vehicle¡¯s windshield.</p>
<p>Overall, for anyone who wants a wide variety of sizes to choose from, the decision of going with Trico Force isn¡¯t a bad one at all; the windshield wiper is available in a variety of different sizes, are really, really easy to install, and hold up really well against the majority of different weathers. Needless to say, the Trico Force are easily one of the best wiper blades out in the market at the moment.<div class="su-row">

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002Z9QWQ/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1310 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/PIAA-Super-Silicone-Review.jpg" alt="PIAA Super Silicone Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>PIAA Super Silicone is not a really charming name for a windshield wiper or for any product for that matters, however, it doesn¡¯t mean that we won¡¯t be testing it in order to find out whether or not the windshield wiper we¡¯re looking at is actually good enough to be on this list.</p>
<p>Well, since it¡¯s already on the list, the cat¡¯s out of the bag, and you are already reading what we have to say about the windshield wiper. Now while the name isn¡¯t super creative, this windshield blade is a company that believes that going simple is the best way to actually make the most of their product.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the review sample, we were told that this windshield blade is made from specially patented silicone rubber, and while not many details were given to us, we were told that this patented silicon rubber will ensure that the silicone manages to resist against all the wears and tears as well as all the damage that can be caused by UV rays.</p>
<div class="redb">Believe it or not, UV rays from the sun are really damaging to the rubber and considering how you are someone who tends to drive a lot, or your car stays out more than it should, it¡¯s not something of a smart decision in the first place.</div>
<p>The windshield blade is available in the majority of sizes in order to make the experience a lot easier for you, and it doesn¡¯t matter what the windshield of your vehicle requires, there is a solution available for you.</p>
<p>The whole wiper blade is made in such a way that even when the silicone wipes itself off of the windshield, there are absolutely no streaks left behind. Do keep in mind that streaks are something that can be very annoying, and this silicone rubber makes sure that the whole existence of streaks is completely taken care of.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>To be really honest, we didn¡¯t expect this windshield blade to do a lot of work, mainly because we never really heard much about this company. However, the good thing is that this brand left us surprised, and in awe.</p>
<p>Overall, the performance of these blades proved to be one of the best in class, and they were really easy to install.</p>
<p>The construction was also solid, making them one of the best windshield wipers that are currently available in the market for the consumer to buy without really facing any issues like stock running out. This is because these are pretty famous actually, and the stocks are always available to ship out as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00496F0HY/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1311 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ACDelco-Metal-Review.jpg" alt="ACDelco Metal Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>We just have to more wiper blades left on our list to review and we will be done. Now generally when we are looking at the end of the least, we are usually taking a look at some of the items that are less impressive. However, here at 10Beasts we normally follow a different rule that ensures that each and every single product in our list can be considered the best out of the respective type of product we are looking at.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, say hello to the ACDelco Metal, another decisively named windshield wiper that made us skeptical in the beginning but thanks to the consistent performance, it somehow managed to make it to the list.</p>
<p>Now before we begin and get into the details, we would like to actually take a look at some of the concerns that made us reluctant while reviewing this set of wiper blades. For starters. The wiper blades don¡¯t really come in a different size, they have one size, and to our surprise, we weren¡¯t even told.</p>
<p>Luckily, the size managed to be the most standard with sedans, and the wiper blades fit in perfectly. Now do keep in mind that the product page suggested that this is actually made entirely out of metal and while this may raise some big concerns, and some eyebrows as well, the good thing is that the entire metal structure is covered.</p>
<p>In case you don¡¯t know, the covered structure is really good because by the approach, it¡¯s really easy for the exposed structure to have debris stuck in it, and stuck debris can completely destroy the wiper blade, that¡¯s why we should always ignore the wiper blades because if not, then we¡¯re only getting ourselves in a rut.</p>
<p>Overall, the ACDelco Metal is a really good wiper blade that you can buy right now, sure, there are some shortcomings like not having multiple sizes available, not giving some proper information about the product on the product page.</p>
<p>If you are okay with these shortcomings, then the good thing is ACDelco Metal isn¡¯t really a bad windshield wiper, as a matter of fact, it¡¯s great, and in majority of cases, it works just as intended. So, you can simply go ahead and make the purchase without really facing any issues.</p>

<h2>10. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AYAIC60/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="ten">Michelin Stealth Hybrid</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AYAIC60/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1312 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Michelin-Stealth-Hybrid-Review.jpg" alt="Michelin Stealth Hybrid Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The last product on our list is the Michelin Stealth Hybrid, and while most of the people will be impressed by the name just like we did, the true question is whether or not this wiper blade lives up to the name. Well, if you want the shorter answer, then the answer is yes.</p>
<p>However, if you want a longer, proper answer, then you should keep reading because we are going to reveal some of the best bits about this windshield wiper blade. For starters, the Michelin Stealth Hybrid is available in a variety of different sizes, and this is really good for people who really don¡¯t want to struggle with finding the right fit for your vehicle.</p>
<p>You can simply confirm it with your vehicle¡¯s vendor, if you¡¯re getting it online, you can check it through the handy compatibility tool that is usually available on the product pages. Now moving on, Michelin has decided to keep things safe and simple and decided to go with rubber installation, and while some people may turn away from this, the good thing here is that rubber is actually the best material used in the construction of the best windshield wipers.</p>
<p>Another good thing is how the wiper has been designed, Michelin made sure that the design is as practical as possible, and even if it¡¯s curved, it will fit really, really well. Not to forget, the windshield wipers come with a rather easy to understand locking mechanism.</p>
<p>The mechanism itself is really easy to operate, and apart from that, you can simply install it yourself. This means that you won¡¯t have to hassle around with the wipers, and that¡¯s a positive point. In addition to that, the overall build quality is rather nice, and the wiper blades are covered so that will prevent anything getting inside the structure and potentially destroying the blades.</p>
<p>Overall, the Michelin Stealth Hybrid is a really well thought out wiper blade that does a lot of good things, the fact that Michelin decided to with simplicity rather than using fancy terms that won¡¯t make sense to a lot of people only tells that the company has confidence in the product that they have created.</p>

<h2>Windshield Wipers &#8211; Buyers Guide</h2>
<p>Now when it comes to windshield wipers, they are mostly constructed out of flexible metal along with some sort of rubber coating on top of it to prevent it from getting damaged early. Now, these windshield wipers use different kind of blades that are used to clean the windshield.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that when we say blades, we basically mean that we are not talking about steel or metal blades, instead, these blades are made out of softer material that can¡¯t really damage the windshield when wiped on it.</p>
<p>In order to avoid any confusions, we are going to name the most commonly used windshield blades that are installed in these windshield wipers. So, without further ado, let¡¯s take a look.</p>
<div class="su-tabs su-tabs-style-default my-custom-tabs" data-active="1"><div class="su-tabs-nav"><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Rubber Blades</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Silicone Blades</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Coated Blades</span></div><div class="su-tabs-panes"><div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>Perhaps the most common type of material that is used in these wipers is rubber, the rubber blades are common because they are easy to find and really easy and inexpensive to manufacture. Now keep in mind that due to the fact that rubber is cheap and can degrade based on the intensity of usage, rubber blades are often the first ones to give up.</p>
<p>However, that doesn¡¯t mean the rubber wiper blades are bad by any measure. As a matter of fact, a lot of car manufacturers are putting rubber wiper blades into their cars. So, make sure that you don¡¯t just go ahead and buy some other material just because someone told you that rubber blades get easily ruined.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind that rubber blades aren¡¯t created to last long and will require you to change them every now and then, but the good thing is that they are cheap and you can change them every now and then without really going through much of a hassle.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>The technology has progressed somewhat and we now have silicone wiper blades, and for those who don¡¯t know, silicone wiper blades are a lot more durable than rubber wiper blades, however, at the same time, silicone costs a bit more than rubber.</p>
<p>Apart from the cost and durability, one more thing that is important to know is that silicone wiper blades are not easy to form and craft, that¡¯s why not a lot of wiper manufacturers are bringing these wipers in just yet.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, the good thing is that the companies that are bringing these wipers in are receiving some great critical and commercial reception. Unlike rubber, silicone doesn¡¯t really get dried off in different seasons, this means that while rubber blades last shorter, the silicon blades last longer.</p>
<p>The only difference here is that the silicone blades are just slightly more expensive, but considering how you won¡¯t have to change them every now and then, it¡¯s completely justifiable. Also, another thing to keep in mind is that these type of blades are commonly used in sports cars as well as off-road vehicles that are subjected to a lot of force.</p>
<p>However, the good thing is that most manufacturers have started making the same blades for standard cars that are available to the common folk as well.</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>Coated blades are also the type of windshield blades that are becoming more and more common, and instead of changing the rubber for some other material, they are actually just coated on top of the rubber to make it last longer.</p>
<p>Now in case you are wondering, rubber is coated with materials like Teflon or graphite, and while that may seem like a bad idea but it¡¯s not. Instead of the rubber touching the surface of the windshield, it¡¯s usually the coated material, and this creates a small amount of resistance that¡¯s barely noticeable if at all.</p>
<p>However, the real benefit here is that thanks to the Teflon or graphite coating, the rubber¡¯s overall lifespan becomes a lot longer than it usually is. Plus, another great thing here is that even if the rubber ends up drying out, the coating remains as good, and doesn¡¯t wear out that fast.</p>
<p>Graphite and Teflon coated wiper blades are certainly a bit more expensive, but this approach can save you some money in the longer run because that way you won¡¯t have to really change the wiper blades again and again. This is something you should definitely consider.</div></div></div>
<div class="redb">Before you go ahead and purchase wiper for your vehicle, we would suggest you do some research, and the reason why this research is important is because if you don¡¯t do it, you may end up getting the wrong wiper that may not work at all with the vehicle you own.</div>
<h3>Few things about wiper blades which you must be aware of!</h3>
<p>Now there are a lot of best wiper blades available in the market, and a lot of people think that they are universal and will fit on almost all the vehicles there are. However, the truth is different as they use different mounting mechanisms.</p>
<p>So, in order to make sure that your buying experience isn¡¯t as terrible as it could become, we are going to take a look at some of the things you should know before buying windshield wipers.</p>
<p><strong>Without further ado, let¡¯s take a look, shall we?</strong></p>
<div class="su-tabs su-tabs-style-default my-custom-tabs" data-active="1"><div class="su-tabs-nav"><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Size of the Wiper Blades</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Types of Stock Wiper Blade</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Warranty and Maintenance</span></div><div class="su-tabs-panes"><div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>The first thing you need to know is the size of the wiper blade that is installed on your vehicle¡¯s windshield, this is important because if you are in the market for an aftermarket wiper blade, you¡¯re going to need a wiper blade with the same size as the stock one, otherwise there can be some issues with compatibility or installation.</p>
<p>For those who don¡¯t know, the simplest way to determine the blade size is by looking at the size of your windshield, blade sizes are just a little smaller than the windshields so you¡¯ll get the idea. Another thing that you should keep in mind that the blades that are installed on the driver side are different in size as compared to the blades that are installed on the passenger side.</p>
<p>This may seem odd to some, but this design difference is mainly to make sure that both of the blades can work in tandem when activated. If the blades are of the same size, they¡¯ll actually collide when both are turned on at the same time.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you are looking for a blade that goes into the rear window, it will be somewhat smaller than the blades on the windshield due to the size difference.</p>
</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>Another thing you should know the type of stock wiper blade; this is the information that will be used as a reference. Now when it comes to wiper blades, they are either available in beam styles, or bracket styles. It should be made clear that a bracket style blade won¡¯t work on the mounting system that is for beam style, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>One should also know what type of attachments they in order to make the whole buying experience a lot easier. Having all of this information at hand will ultimately help you make sure that your whole experience goes smoothly as possible, and for some weird reason you don¡¯t end up with the wrong wiper blade.</p>
</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>The general rule is that the windshield wiper blades don¡¯t come with any warranty, even if you¡¯re buying from the best windshield wiper blades, chances are that they don¡¯t have any warranty with them. This means that if they end up malfunctioning, you will have to buy new ones.</p>
<p>However, the good thing is that through some proper maintenance, you can actually increase the longevity of these blades. You can do some proper maintenance, and occasional inspections to make sure that there¡¯s no debris or other junk stuck in the blades.</p>
<p>The reason we are talking about debris here is because it is pretty common for these windshield wiper blades to have some sort of debris in them especially if you live in an area that is usually covered in dust, or you drive out a lot.</p>
<p>Simply make sure, and if you find any debris, clear it with some water, and the wipers will be back to normal again. Ignoring this debris can cause the wiper to jam, and in extreme situations, even break.</p>
<p>Now that the readers finally have some information on the wipers, and some things that they should look out for, we can finally go ahead and take a look at the best windshield wipers that are available in the market. So, without further ado, let¡¯s review the ten best windshield blades we have.</p>
</div></div></div>
<h2>Conclusion &#8211; Wrapping it up</h2>
<p>So, there you have it, folks! We tested some of the best windshield wipers available in the market at the moment. While do keep in mind that we just covered 10 because that¡¯s how things normally work, the market won¡¯t treat you the same way.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of windshield wipers available in the market, and as a consumer, it¡¯s up to you to choose. However, making mistakes is easy, and especially when you¡¯re going to buy something like a windshield wiper that most of the people don¡¯t have proper information about.</p>
<p>Well, don¡¯t worry, the guide is here to help you pick the best out of the best windshield wipers are available in the market. We hope that you have a pleasant time picking the right wiper for your needs, and in case you face any trouble while picking up the right windshield wiper for yourself, it¡¯s okay because you can always get in touch with us and we¡¯ll help you with the right decision.</p>

<p>Yes, even for people who do not have enough valid reasons to invest in drones would want to buy. Right? &#8230;</p>
<p>You should also keep in mind that while the drones are super cool, they also happen to be quite expensive, and are often made for enthusiasts, or people who are into experimenting with videography mainly because almost all the good, high-end drones come equipped with amazing cameras.</p>
<h2>Best Drone Cameras 2017</h2>
<p>There are some things you should know about, the drone market is divided into 2 parts; there are the high level, enthusiast grade drones like the DJI Phantom 4, and the DJI T600 Inspire 1, and then there are cheaper options.</p>
<div class="redb">
<p>Now as for the cheaper options, they cost way lower than what you¡¯d expect to pay for a DJI Phantom 4, or other similar competitive products, however, at the same time, these products are considered toy drones. Keeping that in mind, you should know that we went ahead and covered both types because we didn¡¯t want to be prejudiced towards a certain type of drone than the other.</p>
<p>So, you will be seeing some really high-end stuff from the likes of DJI, and GoPro as well as some entry-level toy drones that are targeted towards people who just want to have some fun.</p>

<p><strong>Before we begin, you should know that these drones are also commonly known as Quadcopters due to their appearance and rotors on all 4 ends.</strong></p>
<div class="yb">
<p>There are majorly 2 different type of drones/quadcopters, there is the type that comes without any camera preinstalled or a camera mount that you can use to put a camera there, and then there are the ones that are equipped with really high-end cameras that can shoot videos at 4K.</p>
<p>Now if you just want to have a drone that you can fly around, and show off, you can get the simple one that won¡¯t cost you much. However, if you are a film student or an aspiring filmmaker, and you are looking for something with a high-end camera, you should be prepared to spend a lot of money because drones that come equipped with high-end cameras are really expensive.</p>
</div>
<h2>1. <a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/go/dji-mavic-pro/" name="op1">DJI Mavic Pro</a> &#8211; Best Portable Drone (Casey Neistat&#8217;s Favourite)</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/go/dji-mavic-pro/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1154 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/DJI-Mavic-Pro-Review.jpg" alt="DJI Mavic Pro Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>The first drone camera on our list is the famous DJI Mavic Pro.</p>
<p>Now in case you don¡¯t know, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPG1Xa5Uqwo">Casey Neistat</a> himself endorsed this drone on several occasion and went on saying that this is quite possibly the best drone he has had the chance to use, and that is saying something.</p>
<p>Before we begin, you should know that <a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/go/dji/">D¨¤-Ji¨¡ng Innovations Science and Technology Co</a>. (commonly known as DJI) is a Chinese company that specializes in creating some of the best drones we have seen in the market, they are really famous for their Phantom lineup, something we will be seeing on our list today, and in addition to that, they have some other lineups like Inspire. Needless to say, the company has made sure that it has drones suitable for all sorts of consumers.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>During our entire testing process, we found out that DJI Mavic Pro is, in fact, one of the best drones we have used, and we are going to tell you why is the case.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, let¡¯s take a look at the DJI Mavic Pro, and apart from the pros, we are even going to take a look at some of the things that hold this otherwise amazing drone back.</p>
</div>
<p>The DJI Mavic Pro is super compact, and in case you are wondering how that¡¯s possible, that¡¯s because the drone can be folded, and the size becomes as similar as a small bottle of water, that¡¯s why it¡¯s the top choice, and can be carried pretty much anywhere you want. Other than that, Mavic Pro comes with something very special that is known as OcuSync transmission system; the transmission system gives the drone a transmission range of up to 4.3 miles (7km) of allowing the controller to fly the drone at an impressive speed of 40mph (64km/h).</p>
<div class="blueb">
<p>The DJI Mavic Pro comes with special features such as ActiveTrack, and TapFly; these features are there to make sure that your video shooting goes perfectly well along with the brilliant 4K capable camera allowing you to shoot high-quality images with great ease.</p>
<p>Other feature that lets the drone¡¯s camera see objects coming its way and easily avoids them, this combined with sensor redundancy gives you unmatched flight safety along with reliability.</p>
</div>
<p>It also has something known as vision positioning technology that works in parallel with GPS and GLONASS making sure that the positioning remains precise whether you are indoor or outdoor. Thanks to the advanced sensors and tech, you can easily control the DJI Mavic with your phone with the help of WiFi, this is really good, especially when you¡¯re feeling lazy indoors and want to play with the drone.</p>

<h2>2. <a href="https://shop.gopro.com/International/karma" rel="nofollow" name="op2">GoPro Karma</a> &#8211; Another Legendary Drone from GoPro</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.gopro.com/International/karma" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1159 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GoPro-Karma.jpg" alt="GoPro Karma Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>The next drone on our list may come as a surprise to some of you, and the reason is quite simple.</p>
<p>GoPro is basically this really good company that has created active cameras for ages, these small cameras are powerful enough to record videos at true 4K, they can be taken anywhere, and mounted to pretty much anything.</p>
<p>Needless to say, GoPro has singlehandedly dominated the active camera market, and while there have been a lot of competitors, nothing has managed to come close to the amazing cameras by GoPro.</p>
<div class="yb">Considering their expertise in the ¡°active¡± industry, GoPro has decided to jump into the drone industry as well and released the GoPro Karma. Now a lot of eyebrows were raised about the Karma, and people were still in doubt up until Casey Neistat showed up with the first ever hands-on video, and showed just how impressive, and fast the GoPro Karma is.</div>
<p>With all the good things aside, you should know that the review is completely based on the earlier opinions of the prototype version, with that said, we don¡¯t doubt the capabilities and prowess of the GoPro Karma at all. In our personal opinion, if there¡¯s any drone to challenge DJI Mavic Pro, it¡¯s the Karma by GoPro.</p>
<p>Just like the DJI Mavic Pro, the GoPro Karma is extremely portable thanks to the fact that the wings can fold into the drone itself, making it easier to carry around. The Karma is extremely easy to operate for both seasoned flyers as well as newcomers, thanks to the easy to understand control schemes, and an intuitive UI. The drone comes with an app named GoPro Passenger, this app lets your friends view your drone fly, and even control the GoPro as they wish to.</p>
<p>Apart from the built-in camera, the GoPro Karma actually supports a number of different GoPro cameras including the Hero 4, Hero 5 Black, and Hero Session. The drone ships with a GoPro Karma grip in order to have the best possible, and smoothest video recordings.</p>

<h2>3. <a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/go/dji-phantom-4/" name="op3">DJI Phantom 4</a> &#8211; Best Professional Drone in this List</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/go/dji-phantom-4/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1163 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DJI-Phantom-4-Review.jpg" alt="DJI Phantom 4 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>We are taking a step down and going to talk about some of the legends now.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the only reason it is not in our Top position because of it&#8217;s huge, big and bulky design which makes it less portable as compared to Mavic or Karma. Other than that, this is the most polished and professional Camera Drone out there.</p>
<p>For those who don¡¯t know, the DJI Phantom 4 is perhaps the <strong>most popular drone</strong> that is currently available to buy in the market. In case you are wondering how good this is, Casey Neistat has been using this drone, and as a matter of fact, he has a total of 7 Phantom 4s with him.</p>
<p>With that said, that should be one reason to buy the drone, however, for those who are looking for more than just personal preference, don¡¯t worry, we have you covered. We managed to get our hands on the DJI Phantom 4, and our testing process revealed that this is, in fact, one of the best drones that are available in the market. In case you are wondering what made it so good, check out our complete review below.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>The DJI Phantom 4 comes with the ability to takeoff as well as the ability to come back home on its own, all of this thanks to the brilliant GPS technology. The Phantom 4 is extremely easy to operate and comes with an app that lets you control, and monitor all the brilliant camera operations with great ease and convenience.The camera on the Phantom 4 is extremely well made, and can easily let the user capture videos in 4K at 30 fps. In addition to that, the camera also supports the maximum resolution of 12 megapixels in photos.</p>
<p>The camera has an impressive f/2.8 lens that offers a rather wider field of few for people who want extremely crisp, well detailed, and clear pictures. It also comes with a technology known as Gimbal stabilization technology, this technology is good enough to offer users a great hover function, along with the ability to capture brilliant footage even when the drone is in the air and moving around.</p>
<p>Users can use the included DJI director software that has a built-in video editor in order to edit their video as they please; the editor lets you add text, music, and a couple of other options as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="redb">Although beautiful, the Phantom 4 is only available in white color, something that may put off potential buyers. Battery life isn¡¯t as good as we would want it to be, and the drone is quite expensive.</div>
<p>So, there you have it. Is the DJI Phantom 4 a good option for those who are looking to spend top of the line money?</p>
<p>Yes, as a matter of fact, it is one of the best drones we have used in a long, long time. It lives up to the amazing legacy that has been created by DJI, and that¡¯s something to say. In case you are wondering if we have any complaints with the drone, well, there is one downside to the DJI Phantom, but that¡¯s totally subjective, still, for those who are willing to know, the negative point is mentioned below.</p>

<h2>4. <a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/go/dji-inspire-1/" name="op4">DJI Inspire 1</a> &#8211; Professional yet Expensive</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/go/dji-inspire-1/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1164 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DJI-Inspire1-Review.jpg" alt="DJI Inspire1 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>The next drone on our list is another one from DJI, and this one is called the DJI T600 Inspire 1; this drone actually comes with the option to be controlled with 2 controllers, and there¡¯s one that only has 1 control with it. It¡¯s all up to you.</p>
<p>Now in case you didn¡¯t know, this drone also comes with a 4K video camera, and it actually is really good for video recording; perfect for people who are experimenting with videography, and love to record high-quality videos that are brimming with details, colors, and sharpness. Now, as compared to the DJI Phantom 4, this one has a different design, and it¡¯s actually more aggressive than the Phantom 4 as well. With that said, that doesn¡¯t make it a bad drone as it is one of the best ones out in the market. So, without further ado, let¡¯s take a look at the advantages that made the DJI T600 Inspire 1 one of our favorite drones.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no denying that the DJI T600 Inspire 1 is actually one of the best drones we have seen in a long time, it is surely an expensive one, and can get even more expensive if you are willing to get the one that comes with 2 controllers, but other than that, there¡¯s no denying that the drone is simply amazing. Believe it or not, it can actually take on the Phantom 4. If you¡¯re wondering whether or not we encounter some downsides with the T600 Inspire 1, you should know that we have, though they are not deal breakers, they are still there.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>The T600 Inspire 1 comes with a ready to fly system, which means that everything you need to fly this beautiful drone is already added in the box. All you need to complete your experience is a mobile phone or a screen and you will get a live HD view of the beautiful capturing. The arms on the DJI T600 Inspire one are made out of really strong fiber, these arms remain completely out of sight, which means that all of your video recordings will go smoothly, and you won¡¯t be seeing the arms interfere the videos at all. The camera on the DJI T600 Inspire 1 is capable of shooting videos at 4K and has the ability to take crystal clear, sharp, and very detailed photos at 12 megapixels, this makes the Inspire 1 one of the best drones for photographers as well as videographers.</p>
<p>Users can easily remove the gimbal and the camera system from the T600 Inspire 1; this allows the user to easily upgrade in future, or simply have the whole drone carried safely from one place to another.</p>
<p>The drone can easily be connected to your mobile phone in order to provide you a real-time, live feed straight from the drone¡¯s camera onto your phone; the video is viewed on your phone in 720p, and a great feature for those who want to be fully aware of how the recording is going on. While the professionals will obviously love the drone as it is, newcomers will be glad to know that the drone is extremely easy to setup, and even easier to fly once you have the proper hold of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="redb">Sadly, as good as the flying experience of the DJI T600 Inspire 1 is, the battery life is terrible, and the drone only managed to last us 18 minutes on full charge. Separate accessories such as the controller, and the battery can hike the price of this drone drastically.</div>

<h2>5. <a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/go/dji-phantom-3-pro/" name="op5">DJI Phantom 3 (PROFESSIONAL)</a> &#8211; One of the Best Aerial Videography Quadcopter</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/go/dji-phantom-3-pro/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1166 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/DJI-Phantom-3-Professional-Review.jpg" alt="DJI Phantom 3 Professional Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>There is no denying that the DJi¡¯s Phantom series of drones have become sort of a benchmark for the top of the line consumer drones, although they are made with consumers in mind, they are equally alluring for the most professionals out there.</p>
<p>In case you don¡¯t know, the popular YouTuber/filmmaker Casey Niestat has been using the DJI Phantom 4 as his primary drone for shooting a lot of quality footage ever since the drone first came out. With that said, today, we are not looking at the Phantom 4, instead, we will be looking at its younger brother that is known as the DJI Phantom 3 Professional. Now when you compare this to the older brother, not much has changed in terms of the looks, however, the Phantom 3 Professional has a bit of a flashier design thanks to the golden accents. However, in case you are wondering about the accents ruining the simplicity of the drone, don¡¯t. They actually complement the drone nicely and are certainly a welcomed addition.</p>
<p>We had the DJI Phantom 3 Professional in our hands for quite some time, and while we were a bit skeptical, we found out some really good things, as well as some minor issues about the drone. However, we are going to take a look at all the good things about this drone. Below you will have all the amazing features that make DJI Phantom 3 Professional such an amazing camera drone to buy. Sadly, much like the other drones, we have seen on the list, this one is also plagued with the familiar issues that we are so used to see. What are those issues, you ask? Well, let¡¯s check them out below, but first, let¡¯s take a look at the pros.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>The DJI Phantom 3 Professional is very, very easy to setup, and is a delight to fly even for the beginners as well as the professionals. The camera on the Phantom 3 Professional is one of the best 4K cameras we have seen; it produces crisp, clear videos that are brimming with details. It is also equipped with vision positioning system that allows the indoor flights to be super smooth, and without any issues. The drone comes with a feature known as the Lightbridge digital streaming, this feature allows the user to live stream 720p videos on the internet, while the full-size video is being recorded and stored internally.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, the Phantom 3 Professional comes with an iOS and Android-compatible application that lets you control the camera, as well as have a live view of everything that is being recorded by the camera on your phone.</p>
</div>
<div class="redb">Unsurprisingly, the DJI Phantom 3 Professional comes at a hefty price regardless of how you buy it (with or without the accessories bundle). Much like every other drone we have seen on the list, the DJI Phantom 3 Professional also comes with a mediocre battery life that lasts somewhere around 20 minutes on a single charge, and buying a spare battery only racks up the cost.</div>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E0ER9WI/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1167 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Yuneec-Q500-4K-Review.jpg" alt="Yuneec Q500 4K Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>We are taking a step away from DJI, and looking at some other options, the next offering we have at our hands is the Yuneeq Q500 4K, and the proper name for this beautiful drone is Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon.</p>
<p>With that said, one can assume that this was made as a direct competition to other drones on our list, and especially the ones from DJI, and it actually can be considered a competition. The drone comes in a stylish carrying case that is oddly large. For those who aren¡¯t too fond of the white, sober looks of the DJI Phantom series drones, you should be glad to know that this one comes donned in black, something Batman would have loved. Still, not a lot of love has been lost as this is one of the prettiest drones we have had the chance to use. Sadly, we can¡¯t really let the looks decide just how good the drone is, so that¡¯s why we decided to put the Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon through the paces in order to see just how good it is. Just like before, we will be keeping our focus on the good things before we take a look at the things that are not so appealing. So, without further wasting any more time, let¡¯s take a look at the good things about the Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon.</p>
<p>From the looks, it may seem that the Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon is actually better than the competition, especially with the competitive price, but doesn¡¯t exist without its flaws. In case you are wondering, there are some obvious flaws to the drone, and we are going to see which ones there are. So, there you have the complete rundown on the Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon, whether or not you are going to buy it, is up to you. However, we did notice that even with all the handsome features, it¡¯s still cheaper than most of the competition, and that is certainly a good thing.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon is capable of offering a smooth, and completely stable 4K video recording that is all nice, sharp, colorful, and brimming with details; the 12 megapixels camera does a great job at capturing amazing stills, and the distortion-free lens proves to be more than just a gimmick. The camera can be used separately and attached to a handgrip included that can be used to take the same beautiful footage and photos on the ground as well. Unlike some other drone controllers, the controller on the Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon is actually based on an all-in-one concept; the controller features a screen that provides you with a first person view of the drone using the camera, along with the ability to access camera controls straight from the screen.</p>
<p>The drone ships with a large carrying case, and has 2 spare batteries that you can use; do keep in mind that you can buy the same drone without the 2 added batteries for a cheaper price. Apart from being controlled through the built-in remote, the Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon can also be controlled through the super compact Wizard remote control. The drone is competitively priced and is cheaper than most of the direct competition with or without the battery bundle.</p>
</div>
<div class="redb">While the drone itself looks pretty compact, there¡¯s no proper way to put it in something apart from the rather large carrying case, making it not so travel-friendly. As sad as it may seem, the Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon comes without any support for the famous waypoint navigation.</div>

<h2>7. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZPM7BOG/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="op7">3D Robotics Solo</a> &#8211; The Best drone for the Money</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZPM7BOG/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1186 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3D-Robotics-Solo-Review.jpg" alt="3D Robotics Solo Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>You may be wondering why have we drifted apart from the famous companies like GoPro and DJI and now are focusing more on the underdogs, well that¡¯s because they aren¡¯t getting a lot of attention, and we are about to change that.</p>
<p>The next Drone/Quadcopter on our list is 3D Robotics Solo, and while the name happens to be very, very uninteresting, the drone certainly isn¡¯t. In case you are wondering, just like the Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon, this drone is also heavily focused on the price to performance ratio, which means that the buyers will be getting more out of the drone for every dollar they will be spending on it.</p>
<div class="blueb">
<p>Now before we begin reviewing this drone, you should know that the consumer drone market is currently divided into 2 parts; one part is dominated by the drones that come with their own cameras installed, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> part is the part in which drones are using the top of the line GoPro cameras.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering which category does the 3D Robotics Solo belongs to, it¡¯s the second one as it does let you attach a GoPro, however, as per the Amazon listing, you would have to buy that separately. Something that is understandable because the drone costs almost 3 times less than the DJI Phantom 4, and still manages to be one of the best drones in the market.</p>
<p>However, if you want everything right at the spot, you can spend extra (still less expensive than the competition) and get the Gimbal bundle that will give you pretty much everything you need, along with a carrying case that you can use to house your drone in.</p>
</div>
<p>With that said, enough chatter about the camera features, and the pricing, let¡¯s see how the 3D Robotics Solo managed to hold out in our testing process.</p>
<p>The drone offers one of the best industrial designs we have seen and comes with complete Gimbal support means that it gets the superior stabilization as well as support most of our beloved drones are known for. The 3D Robotics Solo has a return to home safety feature which allows the drone to return to the position it took off from thanks to the GPS system.</p>
<p>Although the drone ships with a remote control with a powerful 1 GHz processor inside, you can control the drone using an app that is available on both iOS and Android. The ability to attach any camera is a definitely amazing option. The drone is extremely easy to learn and master and will make both hardcore, and newcomers feel right at home.</p>
<div class="redb">As good as the other features of this drone are, the GPS seems to be a bit slow, and can have an issue finding the right positioning. Pretty much like any other drone we have reviewed, the battery life suffers.</div>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FS7SV1U/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1187 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Parrot-AR.Drone-2.0-Review.jpg" alt="Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next drone on our list is something entirely different from the rest, it¡¯s not as big as your go to drones that you can buy in the market, making it perhaps one of the smallest drones we have seen with the rotors attached.</p>
<p>That¡¯s not all, where other drones follow a very aggressively placed design language, the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 actually has a way different design language, instead of going all out, the design is very, very held back, and resembles a flying saucer instead. Whether or not that adds or removes anything from the overall aerodynamics, we are not too sure about that. With that said, for those who are wondering about how much the drone costs, you¡¯d be glad to know that it is very, very competitively priced, and that is completely understandable considering how this drone isn¡¯t really built for professional photographers or filmmakers. Still, that doesn¡¯t mean this drone isn¡¯t good enough.</p>
<p>Now before we begin taking an in-depth look at the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0, we would like to address some confusions; unlike the other drones in our list that are actual, consumer grade, professional drones. The Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 is actually a toy drone, and while you are still getting a camera, it¡¯s not 4K capable, and certainly not made for professional photography. However, you should also keep it in mind that despite the fact that it is more of a toy drone than a full-sized drone, it¡¯s still really, really good, and will provide you countless hours of fun provided you charge it after the battery ends. Another thing you need to keep in mind is this drone doesn¡¯t come with physical controls, and in order to physically control the drone, you require a Nvidia Shield. However, you can still fly the drone using the app with your own smartphone.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 is a nice middle ground between toy and enthusiast device. It&#8217;s not a remote controlled helicopter for hobbyists and it&#8217;s not a quadricopter camera mount for professionals, but it&#8217;s much more than just a toy helicopter.</p>
<p>&#8211; Will Greenwald, <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2424345,00.asp">PCMag</a></p></blockquote>
<p>With that out of the way, let¡¯s stop wasting time, and talk about the pros and the cons of the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>Incredibly simplistic controls make this drone a treat to fly; you can even perform stunts on your drone. Despite not having a high-end camera, the 2 built-in cameras provide plenty of fun functions that are fun to explore and try out. While you need a Nvidia Shield in order to use the physical controls, the drone is highly easy to use even through the phone applications.</p>
<p>All the footage taken through the 2 built-in cameras get stored directly on the phone, something that is really cool. The drone is available in a multitude of different colors.</p>
</div>
<div class="redb">The battery life is expectedly short, pretty much like every other drone we have tested.</div>

<p>You may have noticed that as the list is coming towards its end, we are also beginning to explore drones that are actually way cheaper than some of the drones that we have reviewed in the start.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that we already stated that there will be a sudden shift, so in case you didn¡¯t read the article properly, now you know what we are talking about.</p>
<p>Without wasting any more time, we are going to announce our latest product in line that is known as the Cheerson Hobby CX-20 Professional, now as you can tell by the name, this drone is more inclined towards the hobbyists, however, you should be glad to know that despite the drone not being shipped with a camera, there is a mount ready for a Go Pro that you can attach and start shooting footage at 4K, and taking brilliantly detailed pictures.</p>
<p>Now before we start digging deeper into the details, you should know that the Cheerson Hobby CX-20 Professional shares a close resemblance to the DJI Phantom series drones, and you shouldn¡¯t be worried considering how you can still differentiate between the drones thanks to the red accents on this one. Although this particular drone is very competitively price, and one may think that it¡¯s a toy drone, that¡¯s not entirely true. The drone happens to be quite powerful and comes with a lot of advanced features including vision positioning system, and unlike the AR.Drone 2.0, it actually has a dedicated remote controller that you can use to properly control the drone.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let¡¯s not waste any more time, and take a look at just how good the Cheerson Hobby CX-20 Professional is, weighing in on the pros as well as the cons.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>Comes with advanced features like vision positioning system, pathfinder, as well as auto-return home. The camera mount allows the user to add a Go Pro camera and shoot beautiful 4K footage, and clear stills.</p>
<p>Competitively priced without sacrificing on the build quality. Attractive white design with red accents on the body. Easy to learn, and fun to fly with full physical controls.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PYKOPDO/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1189 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3d-Robotics-Iris-Review.jpg" alt="3d Robotics Iris+ Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>We are finally on the last product that will be going on the list, and just like the previous entries, this again is a drone made specifically for the hobbyist.</p>
<p>Meet the 3D Robotics Iris+, and while the name certainly sounds interesting, we were a bit skeptical about the drone being a mediocre, cheap drone, but to be fairly honest, the drone completely defined out expectations. The 3D Robotics Iris+ is one of the best drones we have used in the entire list, and there are actually a lot of reasons for that. For starters, the drone has a lot of features that are found in high-end drones like the DJI Phantom 4, and other similar drones that are still slightly more expensive.</p>
<p>So, what¡¯s so special about the 3D Robotics Iris+? Well, to be honest, a lot of things, it actually looks better than some of the other drones in our list, and although it doesn¡¯t come with a built-in camera, you can find a mount that you can use to put a Go Pro on your own choice, and shoot beautiful footage in 4K, and take stunning photos thanks to the camera mount you get. With that said, despite the fact that this drone is marketed as a toy, it¡¯s not; the 3D Robotics Iris+ is a large, intimidating drone with a footprint that is as big as the flagship drones we have managed to test.</p>
<p>Some of the good things about the 3D Robotics Iris+ is that each of the arms have LEDs installed on them in order to give you a better understanding directionally, the 3D Robotics Iris+ comes in a bundle that includes several different accessories like a 4GB memory stick, replacement propellers, and spare battery as well. Anyway, without further ado, let¡¯s take a look at the pros and the cons of the much loved and adored 3D Robotics Iris+.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>The drone is very, very stable when it comes to flying. There is no steep learning curve like some of the most common, high-end drones.</p>
<p>The drone becomes a lot capable as soon as you start adding the accessories that are sold separately. You can add pretty much any camera as long as it is compatible with the mounting system. The drone is also equipped with the highly useful and equally popular Gimbal tilt on control. Has a very useful return-to-launch function that works as advertised. Somewhat impressive battery life. The remote control provides you with real-life on-screen telemetry data as you fly.</p>
</div>
<div class="redb">Add-ons such as the camera Gimbal, as well as first-person view, are expensive. The drone doesn¡¯t instantly power down and takes a few seconds for the motors to stop. Remote control can be a bit intimidating for beginners.</div>
<div class="su-row">
<div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-clearfix"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" style="border-color:#009906;"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#00bf08;color:#FFFFFF;">Pros</div><div class="su-box-content su-clearfix"><div class="su-list su-list-style-">

<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> Flight time is not more than 16 minutes</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> Poor Build Quality</li>
</ul>
</div></div></div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><a name="bg"></a>So, there you have it.</p>
<p>Probably one of the most intimidating roundups considering how the market is literally flooded with drones; coming from both the elitist, enthusiast class drones as well as the hobbyist drones. There¡¯s no denying that the market is very, very saturated, and it is perhaps the hardest thing to be able to buy a drone that fits all of your requirements. With that out of the way, you should know that the time is still very, very early for the drones to be fully functional, for instance, there are some rules that are being enforced on the use of drones, however, those are purely for the purpose of national safety.</p>
<div class="redb">
<p>In addition to that, the most common issue right now with pretty much every single drone out in the market is the battery life.</p>
<p>You see, despite having huge, heavy duty batteries, the drones fail to give a decent battery timing, and that is certainly in issue for people who want to have extended flight times. Still, considering how the drones are still developing in the market, and companies are focusing on more and on reducing the overall size, and seems like they will be succeeding in that department. For instance, the Go Pro Karma, as well as the DJI Mavic Pro are some of the most compact enthusiast level drones we have seen.</p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps the next evolution we may see would be the extend batteries, and considering how the best drone can last up to 30 minutes, having a drone that can utilize 2 batteries at the same time should theoretically and practically increase the battery time by double. Still, standing at this point, there is absolutely no denying that the future of drones is certainly bright, and these drones have given a lot of benefits to aspiring photographers as well people who want to shoot some brilliant footage thanks to the ability to attach a GoPro camera; now combine that with the Gimbal system and you have got yourself a killer video making rig that can be really good for your personal projects.</p>
<p>With that said, our last words would be that testing so many drones, each with their own setup and learning curve was certainly not an easy thing, however, we tried our best to assess the situation by making sure we cover every single aspect of a drone, and tell you what¡¯s wrong with, and what¡¯s not.</p>

It is either that or you are actually planning on buying one but you are confused because of the sheer saturation of the market. Be aware that is okay to be confused with such trivial methods, after all, chances are that this is your first time buying a steering wheel.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, there¡¯s a good news for you; the market is filled with wonderful steering wheels from all sorts of manufacturers.</p>
<p>You have <a href="http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/gaming-controllers">Logitech</a> , Thrustmaster and some other very trustworthy brands that have been making the top of the line steering wheels as well as other great peripherals.</p>
<h2>Best xBox Steering Wheel 2017</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-614 size-full" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/xbox-Steering.jpg" alt="xBox Steering Wheel" width="800" height="300" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/xbox-Steering.jpg 800w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/xbox-Steering-300x113.jpg 300w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/xbox-Steering-768x288.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Today, we are going to help you selecting the best Xbox steering wheel you can buy currently in the market. For your ease and convenience, we have listed quite a number of them and left you with their pros and cons as well.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let¡¯s take a look at the best Xbox steering wheels 2017.</p>
<h2>1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Z0UWV98/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Logitech G920 Driving Force</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Z0UWV98/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-601 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Logitech-G920-Driving-Force-Review.jpg" alt="Logitech G920 Driving Force Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>We are starting the list by adding the Logitech G920 Driving Force, for those who don¡¯t know, this racing steering wheel is specifically designed for the Xbox.</p>
<p>However, if you are interested, Logitech released the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Z0UWWYC/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Driving Force G29</a>, that has full support for PC, PS3, and PS4. With that out of the way, before we begin, you should keep in mind that the G920 is an elite class steering wheel that one can use, it has the class and the power to prove it.</p>
<p>The wheel itself is quite classy, yet maintains a certain flash to itself, the buttons are perfectly placed, and one of the best thing about this is that it can easily fit in almost all places. However, players who have actual cockpits for playing this amazing racing game would be glad to know that it works rather well.</p>
<p>At such a point, the only one concern we have with the steering wheel itself is the price itself, the steering wheel costs about $350 if you buy it without a shifter, and if you purchase the shifter, the price goes to above $400.</p>
<p><strong>But considering how Logitech has provided us with a near perfect product, the price is understandable.</strong></p>

<h2>2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IVHQ0KI/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thrustmaster VG Ferrari</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IVHQ0KI/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-605 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Thrustmaster-VG-Ferrari-Review.jpg" alt="Thrustmaster VG Ferrari Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next up on the list is Thrustmaster VG Ferrari steering wheel that is designed specifically for Xbox One. Before we begin, we would like to point out that this steering wheel is so far the cheapest offering we have on the list as it retails for just $90. Yes, that¡¯s right. So how does it fare against the beasts like Logitech G920 and G29? In all honesty, the comparison would be a bit unfair. Let¡¯s find out what the VG Ferrari has in store for us.</p>
<p>Straight out of the box, the steering wheel gives you the top of the line impression of a Ferrari, keep in mind that the design language of Ferrari can be found all over the place. We had our doubts about the build quality because of the price it comes with, but believe it or not, the steering wheel surpassed all the expectations we had, it offers a solid construction and works in every racing game or games that contain driving.</p>
<p>The few issues that we have had with the VG Ferrari are mostly the lack of extra options found in the other racing wheels, and even though the construction feels really solid, it has a cheap, plastic feel to it. But then again, do keep in mind that you are paying $90 for it, and it is as good as things get.</p>
<p>I also recommend you to have a look at <a href="https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/review-xbone-thrustmaster-vg-ferrari-458-spider-racing-wheel.316437/" target="_blank">GTPlanet forum</a>, what they have to say about this xbox steering wheel.</p>

<h2>3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0057OW94E/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mad Catz Wireless Force</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0057OW94E/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-607 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Mad-Catz-Wireless-Force-Review.jpg" alt="Mad Catz Wireless Force Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next up on our list is the Mad Catz Wireless Force, for those who don¡¯t know, Mad Catz is one of the best brands when it comes to delivering 3<sup>rd</sup> party peripherals, they are already the fan favorite amongst the fans of games like Tekken and Street Fighter. So, how does their entry into the market of steering wheels fair? Well, you are about to find out.</p>
<p>This particular steering wheel is aptly named Wireless Force, and its key selling point is, of course, the fact that it is wireless. With that said, the Wireless Force carries the traditional looks and the built quality that Mad Catz is known for; the wheel itself is silver, and has black all around it, though regardless of the color scheme, the wheel looks quite solid. Moving on to the functionality, the Wireless Force performed actually well in almost all the tests we put it on. The wheel was put against something as serious as Forza Motorsport, and to test how good it performs in games that have an arcade-rescue driving style, we tested the wheel in GTA V and cruised around Los Santos in a number of different cars. Our thoughts? The steering wheel did a rather amazing job. The feedback was responsive as it gets and felt really powerful.</p>
<p>So with so many good things to write home about, do we have any issues with the wheel? Well, yes; although the construction of the wheel itself is amazing, the pedals feel like they are made out of cheap and low-quality metal, and lastly, although the steering wheel itself is wireless, you still need a power outlet to run it.</p>
<p>Other than the small gripes, the Wireless Force by Mad Catz is an amazing steering wheel that is built for comfortable and fun gaming. If you are looking for something under the sub $300 category, nothing could be better at such a price.</p>
<div class="su-button-center"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0057OW94E/?tag=10beasts-20" class="su-button su-button-style-default affb" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#ff9900;border-color:#cc7a00;border-radius:50px;-moz-border-radius:50px;-webkit-border-radius:50px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:8px 24px;font-size:18px;line-height:27px;border-color:#ffb84d;border-radius:50px;-moz-border-radius:50px;-webkit-border-radius:50px;text-shadow:none;-moz-text-shadow:none;-webkit-text-shadow:none"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right" style="font-size:18px;color:#FFFFFF"></i> Buy Mad Catz Wireless Force now from Amazon</span></a></div>
<h2>4. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ENFVS5Y/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thrustmaster TX Racing Wheel Ferrari 458</a> &#8211; Italia Edition</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ENFVS5Y/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-610 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Thrustmaster-Italia-Edition-Review.jpg" alt="Thrustmaster Italia Edition Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next up on the list is the aptly named TX Racing Wheel Ferrari 458 Italia Edition by Thrustmaster, for those who don¡¯t know, this steering wheel comes in 2 editions; the Ferrari 458 Italia Edition, as well as the leather edition. We will be reviewing the leather edition later in this post, but for now, let¡¯s stick to the Italia edition and see what Thrustmaster TX Racing Wheel Ferrari 458 Italia Edition has in stores for us.</p>
<p>As you would expect, the racing wheel comes with the iconic Ferrari branding in the middle, when it comes to looks, the steering wheel is quite minimalistic and doesn¡¯t have any over the top elements, and without any surprises, it supports both Xbox One and PC. The construction of the steering wheel is pretty solid and it won¡¯t be failing on you. However, having used both the leather edition and the Italia edition, it is safe to say that the leather edition has a lot more premium feel to it. However, you should keep in mind that where this one retails for about $300 give or take, the price for the leather edition is about a hefty $470, and that¡¯s a $170 premium for some feel good materials.</p>
<p>The performance on the Thrustmaster TX Racing Wheel Ferrari 458 Italia Edition is no joke, the steering wheel performed absolutely well in almost all the games we tested it on, but for the readers, the games that we tested were; Grand Theft Auto V, GRID, Forza Motorsport, and a couple of others. You¡¯d be glad to know that all of the games worked perfectly fine without any major problems. Also, if you are anxious to know how good or bad the force feedback and vibration on this steering wheel was, then you should be happy to know that both the elements were really good, they felt strong, responsive, and smooth.</p>
<p>So with so much to offer, is there anything this racing wheel can¡¯t do? Well, in short, no. The steering wheel was able to handle everything thrown at it gracefully. You can go ahead and nitpick about the construction, but deducting points on that basis won¡¯t be making any sense. With that out of the way, the TX Racing Wheel Ferrari 458 Italia Edition is definitely one of the best racing wheels available in the market, it offers a cool Ferrari branding and has enough to keep everyone satisfied.</p>

<h2>5. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L6AVN6S/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HORI Racing Wheel One</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L6AVN6S/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-609 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/HORI-Racing-Wheel-One-Review.jpg" alt="HORI Racing Wheel One Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next up on the list is HORI Racing Wheel One, perhaps the best steering wheel for budget oriented people and you know what else is amazing about this one? It is actually officially certified by Microsoft to be used with the Xbox One. Now you can go show off your certified hardware to your friends. But is it actually worth the somewhat budget oriented $80 price tag? Let¡¯s go ahead and find out.</p>
<p>The HORI Racing Wheel one comes with an all plastic construction, something that might be a letdown to some of the buyers, however, considering how it costs less than half of the likes of VG TX by Thrustmaster and G920 by Logitech, it¡¯s fairly justified. Considering how the manufacturers wanted absolutely no bling in the HORI Racing Wheel, they ended up cutting down some of the features that make racing wheels so popular among the fans of racing games; for instance, this racing wheel doesn¡¯t have any support for force feedback or vibration. This might be a deal breaker for people who plan on using this steering wheel with games like Forza Motorsport as it seems that it is better suited to people who¡¯d be playing arcade racing games where the force feedback isn¡¯t that necessary.</p>
<p>Despite being a solid offer for 80 bucks, there are some things about the HORI Racing Wheel One that you wouldn¡¯t like; the exclusion of force feedback is a big no for a lot of gamers, and the only mounting system that is being offered by the steering wheel uses suction cups in order to have the unit stick on a surface. If you can overcome these shortcomings, then you would be pleased to know that HORI Racing Wheel is a great budget oriented steering wheel.</p>

<h2>6. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0151K6FPC/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Thrustmaster VG TX Racing Wheel</a> &#8211; Leather Edition</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0151K6FPC/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-608 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Thrustmaster-TXl-Ferrari-458-Review.jpg" alt="Thrustmaster TXl Ferrari 458 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The last one on the list is Thrustmaster VG TX Racing Wheel-Leather Edition, you might be wondering why we are reviewing something that has been reviewed earlier, but you should know that the one previously reviewed was the simple edition and this one happens to be the leather edition. If you are willing to go for something that is the premium in looks and equally amazing in performance, then the Thrustmaster VG TX is something that you should get. Basically, the steering wheel comes in two different variants, the one that has leather and the one without leather. Before we begin, we would like to point out that the VG TX is made as a direct competitor to the Logitech G920, however, unlike the competition, has support for PC as well as Xbox One, with that out of the way, let¡¯s talk about how good Thrustmaster made this steering wheel.</p>
<p>Straight out of the box, you will be welcomed with premium quality leather that graces the wheel, and considering how the leather is one of the finest, the price gets justified. The steering wheel itself has all the necessary functions you need in order to play a racing game without any issues. One thing a lot of people complain about in a steering wheel is the lack in the amount of force feedback it offers, lucky for you, you will be welcomed by a force feedback that is strong and responsive as hell.</p>
<p>So is there anything lacking in the Thrustmaster VG TX? Nothing for a common consumer, however, if you are a hardcore enthusiast and like to nitpick on every single thing, then you might be annoyed by the fact that the pedals on this steering wheel can¡¯t be inverted, and also the fact that the pedals are mostly made out of plastic, and are quite uncomfortable when you are using the pedals for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>In short, the Thrustmaster VG TX is perhaps one of the best steering wheels you can buy for your Xbox One, not only Xbox One, but it also has full support for PC and works well on all the racing games and even games that incorporate driving into them somehow. With that out of the way, the steering wheel offers solid construction and has more than enough to offer for a peripheral that comes at a reasonable price.</p>

<p>The next on our list isn¡¯t exactly a racing wheel but a cockpit for steering wheels, we are taking a look at the Openwheeler Racing Wheel that is a complete cockpit that is designed for several different steering wheels including the famous G29 and G920 by Logitech as well as some other famous brands like Thrustmaster. The cockpit retails at around $400 but is it worth the price? Let¡¯s find out in the review.</p>
<p>Several different reviews have acclaimed this chair to be one of the best ones that are currently available in the market and has also called it a ¡°true racing seat¡± although the chair is available in several different colors, our review unit arrived in red black accents. Upon finally unboxing the chair, it was revealed that it is made out of the highest quality material and doesn¡¯t compromise on the quality at all. The chair was comfortable to use by everyone we allowed to test the chair, and has a lot of adjustment options that will please everyone, it doesn¡¯t matter if you are tall, big, heavy, or short, the chair will adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>At $400, the chair is way more than what you can get. It is made using top of the line material and has more options to keep everyone happy.</p>

<h2>Final Word &#8211; Wrapping it up</h2>
<p>As compared to the early days, the peripheral market is saturated by all the 3<sup>rd</sup> party manufacturers. Gone are the days where you would get peripherals only from OEMs like Microsoft and Sony. Nowadays, more and more 3<sup>rd</sup> party manufacturers are stepping in and bringing some really amazing stuff on the table. For instance, Logitech and Thrustmaster have been bringing some really amazing stuff on the table. If you are looking for PlayStation Steering wheel, you might want to look at here. <a href="http://heavy.com/games/2015/06/best-xbox-one-ps4-racing-wheels-gaming-games/">PS4 Steering Wheels</a></p>
<p>If you are in the market for a new steering wheel to quench your professional thirst for racing games, you will be welcomed with hundreds of choices, and in all honesty, it is very easy to get lost amongst the choices you have. That is why lists like this one exist, the reason is simple, the lists we make are there in order to help people make the most of the money they are about to spend, and contrary to popular belief, steering wheels for consoles are living on because of more and more amazing games that are coming out every year. Take Forza for instance; the game has been around for quite some time and the new installment is also coming somewhere this year.</p>
<p>We hope that the list was good enough for you to make a decision.</p>

<p>Now that we have everything out of the way, let¡¯s take a look at the topic of discussion we have on our hands, today, we will be looking at the best gaming mice that are available in the market for the consumer to buy.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering why this list is being made, well that¡¯s because the market is saturated right now, and every other company is releasing a gaming peripheral including keyboards, headsets, and mice. While it may seem like a walk in the park for hardcore consumers, for people who don¡¯t have a lot of knowledge about these gaming peripherals, things can somewhat difficult.</p>
<p>In order to make sure that doesn¡¯t happen, we have come up with a list of best gaming mice that you can buy in the market. In order to keep things fair and stable, we have included both wirelesses as well as wired gaming mice to make sure that all the readers are thoroughly satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>So, without further ado, let¡¯s take a look at the best gaming mice.</strong></p>
</div>
<h2>1. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZC3I6U/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow" name="one">Steel Series Rival 700</a> &#8211; The only mouse which Vibrates</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZC3I6U/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1277 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SteelSeries-Rival-700-Review.jpg" alt="SteelSeries Rival 700 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>The first gaming mouse on our list is the Steel Series Rival 700, and for those who don¡¯t know, the company¡¯s Rival series is perhaps one of the most popular series that is currently under Steel Series, as for Steel Series itself, the company is the favourite among pretty much every single professional e-sports gamer, and has earned itself a lot of reputation among the most passionate gamers there are.</p>
<p>Before we begin looking at just how good the Steel Series Rival 700, there are some obvious things you should know about this mouse; the Rival 700 is unique in a sense that it carries an OLED display that can display a variety of different things including settings, as well as some GIFs that are specifically made for this display and can be downloaded from several series.</p>
<p>Speaking of the technical details, the Rival 700 is a modular mouse that offers features such as a modular design, RGB lighting, OLED display, adjustable DPI settings with DPI maxing out 16,000 on the optical sensor, and 8,000 on the laser sensor, and yes, you can change the sensor by buying one separately. Sadly, though, as much as we would have wished, the mouse doesn¡¯t come with an ambidextrous design and might be a problem for people who aren¡¯t left-handed. However, that doesn¡¯t mean that the Rival 700 isn¡¯t a good mouse, behind the expensive price lies a really good mouse that fits gamers of all sorts, it doesn¡¯t matter if you are playing an FPS, an <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/tag/en/RPG/#p=0&amp;tab=PopularNewReleases" target="_blank">RPG</a>, an MMO, the mouse is there to serve, and serve you well.</p>
<p>Our only issue with the Rival 700 is that it should have been available for the left-hand users and that the modules that are sold separately should have had a more affordable price tag. With that said, we are going to take a look at both the pros and cons of the Steel Series Rival 700.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1278 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ROG-Spatha-Review.jpg" alt="Asus ROG Spatha Review" width="300" height="250" />Asus took everyone by surprise when they announced their flagship gaming mouse known as the Spatha, if you think the name sounds aggressive, take a look at the mouse itself.</p>
<p>The Spatha, of course, belongs to Asus¡¯ top of the line Republic of Gamers line up, so you should know that you¡¯d be getting a massive gaming mouse that would be filled with feature of all sorts, additional buttons, RGB effects that even sync up to your other ROG branded products such as motherboards, graphic cards, and even the keyboard by Asus.</p>
<p>Now before we start discussing the in-depth details, you should know that Spatha is more than just a gaming mouse, from the construction standpoint, it actually is a marvel, and while Asus¡¯ choice of using magnesium alloy instead of the traditional materials that are used in the gaming mouse. This mouse can be considered quite heavy as opposed to the competition it has, and the price is something only for the hardcore gamers.</p>
<p>With said, if you are wondering about the technical details, you should know that the ROG Spatha comes with an awful lot of programmable buttons, and that¡¯s not all, you also get a charging bad that looks stylish as hell. Now at this point, you may have guessed that the mouse is wireless, well, here¡¯s a catch, you can use it wirelessly without any input lag, and you can use it with the wire as well. You get the RGB lights, and pretty much every other feature you¡¯d expect from a flagship mouse. The mouse comes with 12 programmable buttons that can be programmed as per your needs using the Asus Armoury software, you also get 8,200 max DPI, amazing ergonomics and comfort for long gaming sessions, the main buttons use Omron switches that are rated for a really high click cycle, and even if they wear out, you can always replace them.</p>
<p>We won¡¯t be saying that the ROG Spatha is the perfect gaming mouse, it does have some flaws like the buttons on the side feeling a bit too flimsy, but that doesn¡¯t mean that it¡¯s any less capable. So, without further ado, let¡¯s go ahead and read some of the pros and cons of this mouse.</p>

<h2>3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EWEHI5K/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow" name="three">Razer Ouroboros</a> &#8211; Ambidextrous Gaming Mouse</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EWEHI5K/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-420 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Razer-Ouroboros-Review.jpg" alt="Razer Ouroboros Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next up on our list is the Razer Ouroboros, and in case you don¡¯t know, Razer is perhaps one of the best peripheral company out in the market, that shouldn¡¯t come as a surprise to anyone because it¡¯s simply too good.</p>
<p>This mouse can be called the direct competitor of Asus Spatha but has been around for quite some time. It is again, a wireless/wired combination, and unlike Spatha, it does offer an ambidextrous design making it a top pick for many users. One should keep in mind that the Ouroboros is strictly made for the enthusiasts, and it doesn¡¯t offer features such as the RGB lighting, though considering how it¡¯s a pretty old mouse, Razer may release an updated version with the Chroma lighting in near future.</p>
<p>The mouse we are reviewing today can be called the direct competitor of &#8220;Asus Spatha&#8221; but has been around for quite some time. It is again, a wireless/wired combination, and unlike Spatha, it does offer an ambidextrous design making it a top pick for many users. With that said, one should keep in mind that the Ouroboros is strictly made for the enthusiasts, and it doesn¡¯t offer features such as the RGB lighting, though considering how it¡¯s a pretty old mouse, Razer may release an updated version with the Chroma lighting in near future.</p>
<p>With that said, in case you are wondering about the good stuff that goes into this mouse, well, there is quite a lot. Razer has designed this mouse and kept modification in mind, most of the parts on the mouse can be removed and shifted around, and yes, you do get weight tuning, something most people love. Some of the adjustments include the ability to tune weight, as well as the palm rest in order to get the optimal gripping experience. The mouse also comes with 11 programmable buttons, as well as highly accurate dual sensors to keep everything in order.</p>
<p>There is no way that this mouse is perfect as there are some obvious flaws, for starters, the mouse is pricey considering how after all, it&#8217;s a gaming mouse. In addition to the price, for people who are looking for a simple experience, it can be a bit too confusing. However, don¡¯t let that stop you from buying this otherwise amazing gaming mouse.</p>
<p>So, let¡¯s not waste anymore time, and get right into the pros and the cons.</p>

<h2>4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CEFEMFW/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow" name="four">Logitech G900 Chaos Spectrum</a> &#8211; Best Wireless Mouse for Gaming</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CEFEMFW/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1279 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Logitech-G900-Chaos-Spectrum-Review.jpg" alt="Logitech G900 Chaos Spectrum Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>It shouldn¡¯t come as a surprise to anyone but there is no peripheral list that would be complete without the inclusion of a peripheral from Logitech.</p>
<p>Whether you are talking about keyboards, speakers, or headphones, Logitech has to be on the list simply because they are that good, and no, we aren¡¯t just talking about the gaming peripherals from Logitech. We are talking about pretty much every single type of peripherals that the company has released in its long stay in the industry.</p>
<p>Similarly, a gaming mice list would have been incomplete without the inclusion of the Logitech G900 Chaos Spectrum; now before we begin, you should keep in mind that this mouse can actually be considered a direct rival of much revered Asus Spatha, and the Razer Ouroboros mainly because of the price as well as the amount of features you get, and that¡¯s nowhere near a bad thing.</p>
<p>So, what¡¯s good about the Chaos Spectrum? Well, there are a lot of things, for starters, you can go from 200 to 12,000 DPI on the fly, and that¡¯s really impressive, do keep in mind that this isn¡¯t just software increase, and the DPI is effectively changed across the board, you get the Spectrum lighting, something that is Logitech¡¯s own version of RGB lighting, and you get the legendary software suite that Logitech is known and loved for. The Chaos Spectrum can be used wirelessly and wired, and just like the Ouroborus, does come with an ambidextrous design.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that this is a flagship mouse from Logitech, so if you are concerned about paying a high price, you are also getting some of the finest features, regardless of you needing them or not. With that said, if you are wondering about us encountering any downsides, there aren¡¯t any deal breakers here. Sure, the mouse carries a hefty price tag, and the overall aesthetics of the ambidextrous design might put off some design conscious people, but under the hood, the Chaos Spectrum happens to be one of the MOST powerful, and over the top brilliant gaming mice we have used. So with that out of the way, pros and cons, shall we?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D63UU52/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1280 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Corsair-M65-Pro-RGB.jpg" alt="Corsair M65 Pro RGB Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>Corsair¡¯s foray into the gaming peripheral industry managed to turn quite a lot of heads; mainly because everyone got excited that their favourite case, RAM, and power supply manufacturer is finally bringing in something different on the table, and believe it or not, the foray was a success.</p>
<p>Corsair didn¡¯t just release a product range suited for every budget oriented, as well as well high-end gamers, but they made sure that all the products don¡¯t share a drastic difference between the price they have and the features they give. That means that whether you are buying their mid-high range K70, or their enthusiast range K95, you won¡¯t be sacrificing on the features a lot. That is something really good, and something a lot of other companies don¡¯t follow.</p>
<p>With that said, we are taking a look at the Corsair M65 Pro RGB, one of the best gaming mice available in the market, and certainly made for users who are more inclined towards saving up some money, and still getting a lot in return.</p>
<p>The mouse, as the name suggest, does come with the RGB lighting that can be conveniently controlled through the Corsair¡¯s customization software. The software itself is easy to use, although, it may require some learning curve, but that¡¯s okay. You obviously get buttons to adjust the DPI to your liking, some customizable buttons, as well as a very, very handy weight tuning system that allows you remove some of the weights and put them away in order to make the mouse lighter. Now in case you are wondering, a lighter mouse means your hand will have an easier time gliding it, something a lot of FPS gamers are looking for.</p>
<p>Now essentially, the M65 Pro is definitely a mouse designed for FPS gamers, however, the good thing is that it is suitable to all the gamers regardless of the genre they are playing. So, definitely a plus point right there. With that said, let¡¯s dive into what¡¯s good, and what¡¯s not about the Corsair M65.</p>

<p>We have another gaming mouse from Logitech, and this time, it¡¯s the G502 Proteus Spectrum; to be fairly honest, it¡¯s one of few mice by Logitech that helped the company establish itself.</p>
<p>If you are wondering, the Proteus Spectrum is just an updated version of the bestselling Logitech Proteus Core, the only difference is the inclusion of Spectrum lighting; Logitech¡¯s version of RGB lighting. Where the G900 Chaos Spectrum is built for the enthusiasts who like to fire on all fours, the Proteus Spectrum is aimed at users who don¡¯t want to spend an awful lot of money but still get the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>The Proteus Spectrum comes at a modest price, but for a modest price, you get a lot of features including DPI as high as 12,000 DPI</p>
<p>Speaking of the technical stuff, Logitech didn¡¯t really change anything from the original Proteus Spectrum apart from the fact that they added the RGB lighting system that has pretty much become the industry standard and everyone is using it in their peripherals, be it a mouse, a keyboard, or a headset.</p>
<p>If we are to tell you about just how good the Proteus Spectrum is, there would be a lot of things to tell; for starters, the mouse costs half of what some of the flagship mice cost, apart from that, the mouse has an excellent value for money, 11 buttons that can be programmed however you want them to be, a comfortable design that doesn¡¯t shy away from being stylish, and excellent tracking and response. So, without further ado, let¡¯s take a look at the pros and the cons.</p>

<h2>7. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MYTSDU4/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow" name="seven">Razer DeathAdder Chroma</a> &#8211; Best Budget Mouse</h2>

<p>Back when Razer originally released the DeathAdder, the mouse took the gaming industry by a storm, it quickly became one of the best gaming mice on the market, it actually didn¡¯t cost a lot, and it was everything a gamer wanted.</p>
<p>The company later moved on released a few different mice as well, however, people still missed the DeathAdder, however, Razer finally decided to listen to the fans and came up with the Razer DeathAdder Chroma.</p>
<p>Now in case you don¡¯t know, considering how the RGB lighting has become an industry standard, Razer has gone ahead and invented the Chroma lighting system that can be controlled through their brilliant Razer Synapse 2.0; now the Chroma system is perhaps one of the best RGB implementations we have seen in a long, long time.</p>
<p>With that said, everything about the Razer DeathAdder Chroma is new and improve, making it one of the most impressive gaming mice to step in the gaming industry; in case you are wondering what your money gets you basically get an amazing optical sensor that is capable of delivering an output of 10,000 DPI, and yes, you can control the DPI as per your liking, so even if you want to go lower, you can easily do so.</p>
<p>You also get Razer¡¯s Synapse 2.0, one of the best customization suites you can find when it comes to the software. The good thing about Razer DeathAdder Chroma Is that the company followed the ¡°if ain¡¯t broke, don¡¯t fix it¡± very gracefully, and didn¡¯t bring any revolutionary changes apart from some hardware tweaks, and in our opinion, that¡¯s the best way to do it. Simply put, people who find the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum too fancy, going for a Razer DeathAdder Chroma is the best choice there is. Let¡¯s dive a little deeper into some pros and cons in order to give you a better idea.</p>

<h2>8. <a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B019OQJ9XE/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow" name="eight">Corsair Scimitar RGB</a> &#8211; Most Prgorammable Buttons</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B019OQJ9XE/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1284 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Corsair-SCIMITAR-Review.jpg" alt="Corsair SCIMITAR Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>Corsair decided to jump in the gaming market, and while some thought that it¡¯s just a fad, and the company will move on, the actual plans were a bit different. The company released some of the best gaming peripherals back to back and managed to impress us with what they have in their arsenal.</p>
<p>With that said, while the M65 Pro was largely focused on the FPS gamers, the Corsair Scimitar is company¡¯s attempt at making a great gaming mouse for the MOBA/MMO community. With that out of the way, the mouse comes with a total of 17 programmable buttons, 12 of which are conveniently sitting on a slider on the left side of the mouse, and are mechanical.</p>
<p>When we say slider, Corsair includes a hex screwdriver with the mouse that lets you adjust the slider as per your grip and the reach of your thumb. It¡¯s nice to see Corsair paying attention to the detail. The mouse comes with one of the best sensors in the market, it uses an impressive Pixart ADNS 3988 sensor. The sensor supports a max DPI of 12,000, however, the DPI can be adjusted as per your need.</p>
<p>The mouse is built for users with large hands in mind, and all the buttons are conveniently placed, are responsive, and don¡¯t feel mushy at all. Most of the construction is made using matte/glossy plastic, however, the middle of the mouse is aluminum, giving the mouse a good heft.</p>
<p>The mouse has 4 zone RGB lighting that can be controlled using the Corsair Utility Engine, the same software also works for customizing the mouse like programming the keys, assigning macros, and controlling the lighting.</p>
<p>As far as the performance goes, the Corsair Scimitar is capable of going head to head against the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum, both of the gaming mouse offer something unique, and are catered to different type of gamers, but under the core, they both have very identical performance as far as the sensor is concerned.</p>
<p>If you¡¯re a gamer who doesn¡¯t require a lot of macro keys, then the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum is the obvious choice, however, if you¡¯re someone with a bigger hand, and someone who needs a lot of macro keys, then the Corsair Scimitar takes the win. With that out of the way, there¡¯s no denying that both mice are exceptional.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DT48W5S/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1283 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Razer-Naga-Hex-V2-Review.jpg" alt="Razer Naga Hex V2 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next on our list is the Razer Naga Hex V2, and before we begin, you should know that this is perhaps one of the more revered gaming mice among the MOBA games because of a number of buttons you get, and how you can customize them completely.</p>
<p>However, you should keep in mind that while this mouse is designed specifically for MOBA gamers, you should know that there is no way you can use in other games, however, this mouse is useable for games in which you have a lot of keyboard shortcuts, you can conveniently map them onto the mouse, and use them, thanks to amazing thumb grid.</p>
<p>Razer has gone on the record and stated that the Naga Hex V2 has mechanical switches in the thumb grid to ensure that gamers have the best possible experience, and the switches don¡¯t end up wearing out. Our testing revealed a fair bit of a tactile feels in the thumb buttons, and it was certainly a welcomed addition.</p>
<p>The Naga Hex V2 comes with your traditional features that you can expect in a top of the line Razer mouse; you do get an excellent optical sensor capable of delivering a whopping 16,000 DPI. You also get the much revered Chroma RGB lighting that can be controlled and tweaked through the excellent Razer Synapse 2.0. Oh, yes, there¡¯s more, you can even tweak all the present physical buttons on the mouse, and tailor them according to your own need, keeping in mind that all the buttons can be fully programmed. It¡¯s certainly a big advantage for users who want to make sure they get the most out of this mouse. With that said, we are going to take a look at some of the benefits of the Razer Naga Hex V2, and why is it such a good gaming mouse for MOBA gamers.</p>
<p>Keeping it short, there are a lot of good things about the Razer Naga Hex V2, and there are a couple of bad things, but considering the industry standards, it has become a norm. With that out of the way, let¡¯s take a look at the pros and cons.</p>

<h2>10. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01APA8D2G/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow" name="10">Corsair Sabre RGB</a> &#8211; Budget FPS Gaming Mouse</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01APA8D2G/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1282 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Corsair-Gaming-Sabre-Review.jpg" alt="Corsair Gaming Sabre Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The last product on our list is coming again from Corsair, and this time, it¡¯s the Corsair Sabre RGB.</p>
<p>Before we begin, you should know that the Corsair Sabre RGB, in many ways, can be considered a younger brother of the Corsair M65 Pro RGB.</p>
<p>While a lot of people might be bummed out to know about the downgrade, you actually shouldn¡¯t pay attention to it. The reason is simple, while the Sabre RGB is certainly the cheaper option, a lower price, and a different design gives it an identity of its own, and that is certainly a good thing because, at the given price point, you are getting a mouse that is able to have an impressive 10,000 DPI, a good design that will attract most gamers, and not mention, RGB lighting. So, in simple words, gamers are paying less and getting more when it comes to the Corsair Sabre RGB.</p>
<p>While the Sabre RGB won¡¯t be winning any beauty pageants because of how simple it looks as compared to some other mice we have mentioned in our list, it is certainly a good thing because the mouse is designed with simplicity in mind and it does a great job at that.</p>
<p>The Sabre RGB can simply rest on your desk, and you won¡¯t be bothered by it. No, we are not saying that the design is bad, it¡¯s just stealthy, and that¡¯s how most gamers prefer. You should keep in mind that you won¡¯t be getting any weight tuning system but keeping the price as along with the weight of the mouse makes it clear that you don¡¯t really need weight tuning. You get an excellent 10,000 DPI sensor and RGB lighting, and that should be more than enough.</p>
<p>Sure, as with many other gaming mice, and peripherals, there are good things, and then there are not so good things; same is the case with the Corsair Sabre RGB, and we are going to list down the pros and the cons below.</p>

<h3>Different Mouse for different Type of Gaming</h3>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-396 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Logitech-G502-Versatile-Gaming-Mouse.jpg" alt="Logitech G502 - Versatile Gaming Mouse" width="300" height="250" /></p>
<p>There are various big brands coming up new gaming mouse concepts and products every day.</p>
<p>The big names include Logitech, Razer, <a href="http://madcatz.com/products/mouse/">Mad Catz</a>, CM storm and more. Products from such brands make up the list of the best mouse for gamers 2017. While making your choice you would face the bittersweet problem of plenty,</p>
<p>It¡¯s nice to have a wide variety to choose from, but it gets trickier too. Gamers got to know their choice in games before picking up their gaming mouse. Basically, games are categorized into three genres:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real Time Strategy (RTS)</li>
<li>Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO)</li>
<li>First Person Shooter (FPS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Most gamers prefer one or two of those three game genres. Some might like to play every genre and pick up every game that hits the market. A gaming mouse like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IRHE892/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum</a> would do well for all type of games. Contrariwise Logitech G502 does extremely well at MMO games. For instance, you may never get enough of games like <a href="http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/">League of legends</a>, when you don¡¯t have this mouse.</p>
<h3>Different Type of Mice Grips</h3>
<p>Aggressive grip stance results in attacking repertoire in PC gaming. Every gamer is more comfortable at one grip type over other. While choosing your gaming mouse, you must pick something that fits your favorite mouse grip. There are three types of grip stances, which are commonly preferred by gamers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Palm Grip:</strong> In this grip your hand entirely rests on the mouse. When you like to feel your palms rested, this is probably your favorite grip.</li>
<li><strong>Claw Grip:</strong> It is a ditto of palm grip with some tweaks. The index finger and middle finger is arched backward to make a perpendicular angle for clicking.</li>
<li><strong>Fingertip Grip:</strong> Only two fingers and thumb happens to touch mouse in this grip. Your hand stays in the air entirely.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Different Mice Concepts your must be aware of</h3>

<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Sensor</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">There are two types of sensor in mice- optical and laser. The optical sensor is suited to even the roughest surfaces. Laser sensor, however, performs better on reflective surfaces. In such settings laser sensor, returns excellent DPI. </div></div>
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Acceleration</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">The ratio of pointer speed to the speed of hand movement defines the acceleration on a mouse. It¡¯s measure in G force, where one G equals 9.8 meters per second. Low-sensitivity gamers need to come to terms with acceleration often since they require more hand movements. </div></div>
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Polling Rate</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">Polling rate refers to the transfer and response rate between mouse and computer. It¡¯s measured in hertz and practically ranges between 250-1000Hz on any gaming mouse. Since the mouse is peripheral, the sent data is processed first before action is taken on screen. </div></div>
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Programmable Buttons</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">Programmable buttons makes gaming mice and keyboards more exciting. Gaming mice typically have buttons which can be turned into hotkeys for executing in-game actions a lot quicker. For instance, you can see sniper buttons present on an FPS specific mouse.</div></div>
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Profiles</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">With programmable buttons comes a set of profile settings. You can even specify different actions for buttons while changing characters in any game. With the same mouse, you can smoothly switch between genres and games.</div></div>
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Lift-Off Distance</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">Lift off distance is how high the mouse can be lifted up from the surface before move movements get unresponsive. Mouse software may come in handy to adjust lift-off distances. In competitive gaming, the lift-off distance plays a significant role.</div></div>
<div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-simple su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed"><div class="su-spoiler-title"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Weight</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-clearfix" style="display:none">Last but not the least, weight matters too. Not many gamers care much about it. But weight determines the level of feel during gameplay. Adjustable weights are a trending concept in gaming mice these days. Fine tuning it helps to make predictions easy and increases ease.</div></div>
</div>
<p>There is no denying that buying gaming mice have become sort of a necessity for a lot of people, some do it just to complete their gaming PC, while others do just for the sake of it.</p>
<p>However, there is one important thing a lot of gamers don¡¯t know. Buying a gaming mouse doesn¡¯t necessarily mean that your skills will improve by a drastic measure. Sure, a gaming mouse might help you in some ways, but if you are buying it just for the sake of improving your skills, then you are wrong. In case you don¡¯t know, most professional, e-sports gamers are actually winning all the competitions without the use of a gaming mouse, and yes, it does come as a shock, but they have actually gone on the record and stated that they prefer a standard mouse better simply because they are used to it.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, that doesn¡¯t mean that gaming mice are just gimmicky because they are not. Thanks to their high DPI, programmable buttons, customizable macros, and a lot of other features that are suitable for gamers. That¡¯s why the market is so saturated with gaming mice, there are just too many options for the average gamer to choose from, and while it is certainly a good thing, it also makes a customer really, really confused.</p>
<p>Thankfully, to make things easier for the consumers, as well as for everyone who is reading this article, the choice of gaming mice should help them pick the one they want. That¡¯s why we went ahead and used mice from every single price group, as well as gaming mice that were tailored to specific people or genre of games like the Razer Naga Hex V2 that is built specifically for the MOBA gamers.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this list should solve your gaming mice buying woes, and you will be able to buy the perfect gaming mouse that will complement your play style, as well as the type of grip you have.</p>

<p><strong>but then it became really common in an awful lot of hoverboards.</strong></p>

<div class="yb">
<p>The recall basically meant over half a million hoverboard units going back until they are fixed and sent back. This recall was for the 8 main and famous manufacturers, and the combined number of 15 different models were affected.</p>
<p>While it didn¡¯t seem like a big deal, the property damage that occurred because of the hoverboards ended up reaching $2 million in property damage.</p>

Seriously, though, one look at the Segway miniPRO and you realize that you absolutely want this beast of a hoverboard.</p>
<p>Much like Swagtron, Segway also happens to be a leading manufacturer in the business of hoverboards, however, their miniPRO is a lot different than your usual, run off the mill hoverboards, and that is something for the good.</p>
<p>It packs a lot of features that will suit the needs the advanced and power users. The hoverboard itself is available in 2 colors; the black, and white color and both have red accents on them. In addition to the color, the hoverboard also comes with a handle, something a lot of people would like.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p><strong>As per the norm, let¡¯s take a look at the advantages of the Segway miniPRO.</strong></p>
<div class="su-list su-list-style-">
<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The Segway miniPRO can be connected to your phone using the Bluetooth and the free app that is available. You can then use the app for features such as; remote control operation, anti-theft alarm, speed control, customizable lights, vehicle diagnostics, and firmware updates</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Much like the Swagtron T1, the Segway miniPRO also offers UL2272; this means that your hoverboard is rated with the highest possible safety.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The hoverboard can handle a payload of up to 220 lbs, the overall exoskeleton is light-weight, and made out of durable aircraft-grade magnesium alloy. The hoverboard also offers10.5-Inch pneumatic air-filled tires that are capable of delivering military grade shock absorption to the user.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The hoverboard is equipped with a dual motor engine that is capable of delivering 1600 watts of power all of this makes the hoverboard capable of reaching 10 MPH and distance of 14 miles when charged fully, though the numbers may vary on different terrains.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> There is a padded knee bar in order to provide maximum comfort along with the ability to give precision steering for better control than hoverboards that are dependent on foot-pivot steering.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>To be very honest, apart from the price tag, there isn¡¯t anything wrong with Segway miniPRO.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it¡¯s going to cost you a lot of money, but looking at the construction, and the sheer quality of construction of this bad boy, you¡¯re left wondering whether or not this is a transformer in hiding. Needless to say, the Segway miniPRO is one of the best self-balancing scooters you can buy.</p>
<h2>4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HUBLRSK/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="sbc3">PowerBoard Scooter</a> &#8211; Most Affordable Hoverboard in this List</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HUBLRSK/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1136 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PowerBoard-Self-Balancing-Scooter-Review.jpg" alt="PowerBoard Self-Balancing Scooter Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>The next up, we are going to look at the PowerBoard Self-Balancing Scooter, now you may wonder that there are no extended, fancy model numbers involved here so this would be an ordinary scooter, but don¡¯t let the name fool you.</p>
<p><strong>PowerBoard is one of the most renowned brands when it comes to hoverboards, and this one¡¯s no different.</strong></p>
<p>Before we start getting into the details, you should know that this is one of the more affordable hoverboards out in the market, but we are glad that even the budget oriented price tag didn¡¯t put it in any risks with the specs, or certifications. Obviously, you won¡¯t be getting the fancy features that were available in the Segway miniPRO but that¡¯s okay because this one is half the price.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>Again, like we are doing with every other hoverboard in the list, we are going to the same thing with the PowerBoard and go over the pros of this budget friendly.</p>
<div class="su-list su-list-style-">
<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> As per the requirement of the US government, and the safety standards, the hoverboard does, in fact, come with a UL2722 certification, this means that there is the complete guarantee that this hoverboard won¡¯t overheat, will have the battery short circuit, or spontaneously catch fire.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Considering how the company is based in the USA, most orders are processed on the same day, and the shipment takes really quickly. Something really beneficial for people who are impatient with their shipments.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Despite the budget oriented factor, the hoverboard manages to offer one of the best speeds that can reach 10 km/h.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The entire riding experience of the hoverboard manage to remain smooth and simple; turning it around the corners even at max speeds was an easy job.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> For those who want, the hoverboard ships with a generous warranty of 1 year, in addition to that, the company offers one of the best customer service support you can ask for. Absolutely no complaints there.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>With so much to offer at such an amazing price, one would wonder whether or not the price is justified, or the features are enough. Sure, they may not be enough when you are comparing them to other higher priced models, but in the same price range, nothing can be better than the amazing PowerBoard Self-Balancing Scooter. It is something that will not break your bank and will offer you enough to have fun without any issues.</p>
<h2>5. <a href="https://www.streetsaw.com/collections/hoverboards?aff=149" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="sbc4">Street Saw</a> &#8211; Fastest Hoverboard 2017 (Up to 11 mph)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.streetsaw.com/collections/hoverboards?aff=149" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1137 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Street-Saw-Hoverboard.jpg" alt="Street Saw Hoverboard" width="300" height="250" /></a>The next up, we are going to look a hoverboard that is known as Street Saw, although this hoverboard has its own name, for some odd reason. It is widely recognized by the name of the company.</p>
<p>Still, for those who are interested in knowing the actual name/model of the hoverboard, you should know that it goes by the name <strong>DailySaw 6.5 Inch hoverboard</strong>. We guess people just lost interest in generic name scheming. Moving on from the name scheming, the hoverboard actually looks like your usual, standard hoverboard, though if you want, you can get it in variety of different colours starting all the way from simple black, to weirdly named tickle me pink; you should also know that the hoverboard is actually really good and capable.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>So, without wasting any more time, let¡¯s get into the details and the pros.</p>
<div class="su-list su-list-style-">
<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The hoverboard comes with 2 front facing LED lights that are powerful enough to throw light at least 6.5 feet away from the hoverboard, this is really good for the user as it allows them to see the obstacles that lie ahead of them. This is actually useful for people who are coming towards you.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The hoverboard ships with either battery from either Samsung or LG. The batteries are extremely efficient and can have the hoverboard last 5-6 hours without any issues. However, you should keep in mind that the actual battery endurance depends on the usage.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Much like almost every other hoverboard, this one also comes with the UL2722 certification meaning that the hoverboard is completely safe against all the damages and issues that were found in the early batches.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Apart from some of the very prominent features, the hoverboard also features 6.5-inch tires that are lightweight and makes for the perfect traveling tires, with that said, you should also know that the overall weight of the chassis is lightweight so you won¡¯t be facing any issues.</p>
<h2>6. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FT9VWAI/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="sbc5">SwagTron T3</a> &#8211; Expensive yet AWESOME</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FT9VWAI/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1139 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SwagTron-T3-Review.jpg" alt="SwagTron T3 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>Remember the highly praised SwagTron T1 we reviewed earlier?</p>
<p>Yes, the SwagTron T3 is the upgraded model of the T1, and it¡¯s better than ever. What has changed? Well, compared to the T1, not much has changed in the design department but you do get features such as LED lights, Bluetooth speakers that can sync with your phone, and some additional features. Early rumors suggested that there will be a handle involved as well, but it seems like there isn¡¯t one.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>So, is the SwagTron T3 a worthy upgrade over the T1? Well, let¡¯s find out.</p>
<div class="su-list su-list-style-">
<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The hoverboard comes with the much needed UL 2272 certification that ensures that the hoverboard won¡¯t spontaneously combust. The hoverboard itself has gone through the extensive safety tests that are deemed necessary by the government.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The hoverboard offers a maximum speed of 8+ mph and has a range of 7-12 miles, completely dependent on the users.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> There are two 300-watt motors that are used in some of the high-ends electric scooters.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The lithium ion battery back that powers the hoverboard can be charged in 2 to 3-hour maximum and doesn¡¯t heat up at all.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The hoverboard also has a built-in Bluetooth speaker that can seamlessly sync with your mobile phone, in addition to that, the hoverboard also comes with LED headlights, rubber bumpers, battery indicators, as well as an overall sturdy and light weight shell.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Much like the SwagTron T1, the T3 also come with the patented SentryShield technology as well intelligent battery management that ensures the hoverboard operates safely without any issues.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>While on paper, the SwagTron T3 may not be the fastest, most advanced hoverboard in the market, but it¡¯s the features like the SentrySheid technology as well as the price to performance that makes this a worthy purchase. For those who are wondering if this is better than the T1, well, that¡¯s just subjective. It does have some features that are obviously missing from the T1, but whether or not you¡¯ll be needing them is completely up to you.</p>

This certification means that the hoverboard is actually fitting on all the safety instructions that are given by the government and will not spontaneously catch fire or have its batteries short circuit.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The Razor Hovertrox 2.0 offers an impressive cruising speed of 8+ mph and comes with dual 350-watt motors that are both silent and efficient.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The Hovertrox 2.0 is capable of running up to 60 minutes on a full charge, and while the duration isn¡¯t the best, it¡¯s still commendable. However, you should keep in mind that the riders weight will also matter and will be put into consideration when measuring the total run time.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The Razor Hovertrax 2.0 comes with LG battery, the good thing about this hoverboard is that the batteries can be easily changed, so even if you run out of them while you are out and about, you can change them without any hassle and continue having a phone. For those who are willing to know some technical specifications, these batteries are 36V and are made by LG.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> This is where the things get interesting, the Razor Hovertrax 2.0 comes with Razor¡¯s own EverBalance technology. Through this technology, the hoverboard can actually level itself, and while it may seem like a gimmick, it allows the user to easily stand on it, and ride it when ready.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Last but not the least, the Razor Hovertrax 2.0 comes with features such as blue LED light bar display, fender bumpers, LED battery power indicator, as well as two entirely different riding modes that are suitable for beginners as well as advanced users.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>While we won¡¯t award the Razor Hovertrax 2.0 any groundbreaking awards, the fact that it is one of the most feature packed and one of the best hoverboards in the market can¡¯t be denied, it certainly doesn¡¯t come cheap, but it¡¯s definitely amazing, ad neck to neck with a lot of other hoverboards that are priced in the same category.</p>
<p><strong>Can Razor Hovertrox 2.0 target them and still be a worthy purchase? Definitely.</strong></p>
<h2>8. <a href="https://wclink.co/link/15991/0/1/27350/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="sbc7">Jetson V6</a> &#8211; Beginners Friendly HoverBoard</h2>
<p><a href="https://wclink.co/link/15991/0/1/27350/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1138 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Jetson-V6-Review.jpg" alt="Jetson V6 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>The next hoverboard on our list is a Jetson V6, and for those who are interesting in buying this particular model should know that this particular hoverboard is exclusive to Target only. Still, despite the exclusivity, it doesn¡¯t mean that the Jetson V6 isn¡¯t a worthy hoverboard to buy.</p>
<p>For starters, it is one of the best on the market right now and features some of the finest features. You should also know that the Jetson V6 hoverboard has the entire frame made out of steel and not aluminum that is the common material used in almost every hoverboard you get to see these days. With that said, the Jetson V6 also offers a lot of other options as well.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>Now let¡¯s take a look at some of the reasons why the Jetson V6 made it into the list.</p>
<div class="su-list su-list-style-">
<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The Jetson V6 hoverboard offers a top speed of 10 miles per hour and has an impressive range of 15 miles.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The hoverboard can easily be charged in about 2 hours.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Comes equipped with two 350w motors, and has two 8 inch wheels.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Comes with the UL2722 certification that ensures that the hoverboard is safe from all the flaming and smoking issues that were reported.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The hoverboard also has an app that can be downloaded on iOS and Android; the app lets you control several aspects of the hoverboard including the speed as well as the sensitivity.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Has additional features like Bluetooth 4.0 speakers as well as LED lights in order to add that extra bling and value.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>With all things considered, there¡¯s no denying that the Jetson V6 is a capable hoverboard and a really good at that. However, we just have 1 small issue; the Target exclusivity is something that may put some people off, simply because they prefer some other retailers.</p>
<p>Overlook that, and you¡¯ve got yourself one of the best hoverboards with amazing features as well as quality.</p>
<h2>9. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GG1N6CK/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="sbc8">Hoverzon S</a> &#8211; Self Balancing Scooter</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GG1N6CK/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1141 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HOVERZON-S-Review.jpg" alt="HOVERZON S Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>Now, we are standing at a point where no amount of innovation in standard hoverboards can be done. You can add LED lights, or Bluetooth powered speakers, and that would be it.</p>
<p>However, if you think you want to go a bit further, you can always look at examples such as the Segway miniPRO but do keep in mind that the price on that hoverboard is nearly the double of the standard issue hoverboards. Today, we are going to look at the Hoverzon S; on close inspection, it can easily be said that this particular hoverboard is based on the tried and true, no-nonsense design and features just the right amount of stuff that would be it for the user buying a hoverboard.</p>
<p>As for the price, it is priced same as pretty much every other hoverboard on our list, and that is certainly a good thing because it gives the consumer a lot of options without having the need to stretch their budget. However, the company does claim that there is an ¡°exclusive¡± feature built right into the hoverboard, and we¡¯ll see whether or not that feature makes it the hoverboard of your choice.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>Roll out the advantages, shall we?</p>
<div class="su-list su-list-style-">
<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The Hoverzon S features an exclusive ¡®aegis armor&#8221; that provides a multilayer protection to the battery. Although it may sound gimmicky, but it can actually protect the battery against certain bumps.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Like all the other hoverboards on our list, this one also comes with the much needed UL2272 certification, meaning that the hoverboard is completely safe against issues such as catching fire or getting short-circuited.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The hoverboard features a fireproof exterior casing as well as the sensor pedals.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The company claims that the Hoverzon S comes with a top tier motor, as well as a feature such as gear stabilization that is present in the hoverboard in order to provide a very stable, and responsive control.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The Hoverzon S also features a rather innovative battery management system that can smartly help improve the overall battery performance as well as a top of the line battery management.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Last but not the least, the Hoverzon S comes with 2 different speed modes that are suitable for either the beginners or the experts the switching between these modes can be done on the fly and it is actually really, really convenient for the beginners.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>While there aren¡¯t any improvements in this hoverboard when you compare it with the others, the Aegis armor along with the battery management surely makes it one of the better hoverboards win the market. In addition to that, the hoverboard is available in a total of 6 colors, and all of the colors are priced the same.</p>
<p>Needless to say, you won¡¯t have to pay a bit more just to have a different color.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JUB7H3M?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1142 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Jetson-Rover-V8-Review.jpg" alt="Jetson Rover V8 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>People have already seen, bought, used, and love the Jetson V6, and now, we are going to bring you the upgraded version called Rover V8.</p>
<p>For those who don¡¯t know, this is certainly an upgraded model that was announced last month, and quickly, it has amassed quite a number of followers.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the Jetson V8 is a sure improvement over the V6, but is it worth buying? We are going to find exactly that in this review, but first, let¡¯s talk a little about the hoverboard itself, Jetson actually improved this hoverboard over the original V6 by adding some features such as slightly more powerful motors as well as some design changes that actually look a lot good. While these design changes may not be able to do anything to the practicality and the usage of hoverboard, they sure help the hoverboard stand out.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>Without wasting anymore time, we are now going to take a look at all the things that make the Jetson Rover V8 the best self-balancing scooter in the given price tag.</p>
<div class="su-list su-list-style-">
<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The Jetson Rover V8 ships with two 8.5 inches, inflatable, all-terrain tires. Now, for those who don¡¯t know, these tires are actually built to be used on pretty much every single terrain there is, so it doesn¡¯t matter whether you are traveling on gravel, smooth surfaces, or even grass, your hoverboard will be with you and will travel without having any issues.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Much like every other hoverboard on this list, the Jetson Rover V8 also comes with full UL2722 certification, this means that the hoverboard is fully certified and has cleared all the certifications that are put on by the government.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Another great feature about the Jetson Rover V8 is that it comes with the front as well as rear LEDs that are perfect for both the rider as well as the people who are coming from the front as it will give them a visual cue in order to let them know that there¡¯s someone approaching. While this does sound gimmicky, it¡¯s actually great for people who are out at night with their hoverboards.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The hoverboard also comes with 3 different modes; learning, standard, and pro mode. These modes configure the hoverboard according to your choice and will give a better suited, and more optimal experience.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The hoverboard comes with a dedicated app that you can use to control your hoverboard as you please, and while it may sound gimmicky, it still is a useful feature to have.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Jetson Rover V8 also comes with dual 400w motors that ensure the best possible speeds as well as riding without any issues.</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The Jetson Rover V8 also comes with IP certification making it dust and water resistant.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>The really good thing about the Jetson Rover V8 is that instead of focusing on features that don¡¯t matter, it brings in some of the best, practical features that are loved by the people. Needless to say, Jetson Rover V8 has earned a sweet spot in this list just because it¡¯s such an amazing hoverboard with an amazing list of features that will be adored by both standards as well as power users.<br />

<h2>Self Balancing Scooter Buyer&#8217;s Guide</h2>
<div class="redb">
<p>For those who don¡¯t know, a Self-Balancing Scooter or commonly known as a &#8220;Hoverboard&#8221; is perhaps one of the most popular technologies right now.</p>
<p><strong>In case you people didn¡¯t know, it¡¯s not as old as some would remember.</strong></p>
</div>
<h3>The technology behind a Hoverboard?</h3>
<p>Before we go into the origins of this strange looking device that has taken the world by storm, let¡¯s take a look into what it exactly is:</p>
<p>A hoverboard is basically a board with one wheel at each end, the board in the middle itself actually serves as a platform for the person to stand on, and for those who don¡¯t know, the board in the middle is basically split into two portions so the rider can easily stand on them.</p>
<p>Now yes, the hoverboard is powered by the rechargeable batteries that go inside it, but a lot of people wonder about the technology that moves them in whatever direction the rider wants them to move; well, this is where the good stuff happens; both portions where a person is supposed to stand are equipped with <a href="http://www5.epsondevice.com/en/information/technical_info/gyro/">gyroscopic sensor pads</a>, and if you don¡¯t know what a gyroscopic sensor does, read the definition below:</p>
<div class="yb">
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>By standard definition a gyroscope is basically a spinning wheel or a disk, on this wheel, the axis of rotation is actually able to freely move in any direction or orientation it wants. While the movement is happening, the axis of rotation will remain unaffected even if the whole apparatus is moved or tilted.</em></p>
</div>
<h3>The Origin of Self Balancing Scooter</h3>
<figure id="attachment_1130" style="width: 170px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-1130" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/jb-hoverboard.jpg" alt="Justin Bieber using Hoverboard" width="170" height="255" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/jb-hoverboard.jpg 245w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/jb-hoverboard-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Justin Bieber, Source: <a href="http://office.akmgsi.com/">AKMGSI</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The first sighting of hoverboards started in China in 2014, and soon after that, the device started getting increasingly popular in 2015.</p>
<p>The craze and the hype were so intense that celebrities of all sorts of type started endorsing these hoverboards, and they soon exploded into the mainstream all over the word.</p>
<p>However, the interesting bit is that there is no universally accepted name of these hoverboards, and most of the names you will be seeing on this list are basically based on some of the attributes that are given to them by the companies that distribute them instead of manufacturing them.</p>

<p>Well, now without wasting any further time, let&#8217;s jump on to our top 10 best Electric shavers list.</p>
<h2>1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YJAZZ4/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="790cc">Braun Series 7 790CC</a> &#8211; Rocking the market since 2010</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YJAZZ4/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-640 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Braun-Series7-790cc-review.jpg" alt="Braun Series7 790cc review" width="300" height="350" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Braun-Series7-790cc-review.jpg 300w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Braun-Series7-790cc-review-257x300.jpg 257w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Our first electric shaver in this series comes all the way from German Tech Industry known as Braun. The Braun series 7 is no doubt the most popular series ever built by this company and the model 790cc is the most sold electric shaver of all time. Undoubtedly, it is still the best electric shaver out there and number 1 in our list. Enough Praise, let&#8217;s get into the business now.</p>
<p>The shaver provides amazingly close and smooth shave as compared to others in our lineup. Series 7 790cc is quite different in terms of features from other electric shavers. The face of this electric shaver has 3 trimmers. Two of them are called &#8220;OptiFoil&#8221; while the one within the other two, is called &#8220;ActiveLift&#8221;.</p>
<p>The OptiFoil trimmers help the electric shaver to cover more facial hairs in fewer strokes while the ActiveLift helps to cut out the short and in-grown hairs. Not to forget that this is a Pulsonic electric shaver, which produces 10,000 micro vibrations per minute, which helps the shaver to capture more and more hairs in each stroke.</p>
<p>The head of Braun 790cc is very flexible and can easily move around the contours of your face. The shaver comes with an alcohol based Cleaning and Charging Dock., which can kill the 99% of the germs with the help of a single button. Other than that, there are 3 personalization modes available in this advanced electric shaver known as Normal, Intensive, and Extra Sensitive. You can choose the mode according to your skin type and hairs. There is also a pop-up trimmer for trimming beards, mustache, and sideburns.</p>
<div class="redb">The only downside in this electric shaver is that it is missing <a href="http://myshaverguide.com/wet-and-dry-shaving-technology/">Wet&amp;Dry Technology</a>. However, this feature is available in the other variant of Braun Series 7, known as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BWRLJ6O/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Braun 799cc</a> which is quite expensive.</div>
<p>Overall, the Braun series 7 790cc is my all time favorite and <strong>best electric shaver 2017 </strong>out there in the market. The built quality is great, 3 trimmers, pivoting head, personalization modes and cleaning dock are enough for comfortable and close shave. Other than that, this is one of the most budget electric shaver available in the market. The price is very low as compared to others in our lineup.</p>

<h2>2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012DITQYM/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="9095cc">Braun Series 9 9095CC</a> &#8211; The latest launched electric shaver of Braun</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B012DITQYM/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-649 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Series-9.jpg" alt="Braun Series 9 9095cc Review" width="300" height="350" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Series-9.jpg 300w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Series-9-257x300.jpg 257w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The next one in our list is also from the Braun. This is the latest electric shaver series launched by Braun and our favorite model in this list is Braun 9095CC.</p>
<p>The electric shaver is covered up with all of the shiny chrome plastic, which looks cool!</p>
<p>This electric shaver works in the same way as the above 790cc, the only difference is that 9095cc contains one extra trimmer known as &#8220;Direct &amp; Cut&#8221;. This extra trimmer helps the shaver to align the hairs which grow in different directions and then cut those out. Other than that, the ActiveLift trimmer from 790cc is replaced by HyperLift Trimmer which is a bit more advanced and helps to cut out the flat hairs.</p>
<p>Braun 9095 Pulsonic shaver produce 40,000 cross-cutting actions per minute, please don&#8217;t mix it up with the 10,000 micro vibrations of 790cc. It provides a bit more close shave than 790cc, the difference is not that much to amaze. Pop-up trimmer is also there.</p>
<div class="redb">The reason why it is listed on number 2 is because It is all Plastic while the 799cc contains metal head. Other than that, you are going to pay hell lot of money for the features you really doesn&#8217;t require if you have a normal beard and you shave on the daily basis. However, this electric shaver is a bit more comfortable on the skin.</div>
<p>Braun series 9 9095cc has all of the features of 790cc and it also has the Wet&amp;Dry technology, which helps the user to use this electric shaver either on dry skin or with shaving gel for sensitive skin.</p>
<p>I recommend you to read this review if you want to have a look at the <a href="http://www.yosaki.com/braun-shaver-series-9-9095cc-review-vs-braun-series-7/">comparison of Braun Series 7 and Braun Series 9</a>.</p>
<p>Wrapping it up, the braun series 9 9095 has all of the great features including Wet&amp;Dry technology which was missing in the above 790cc. It contains one extra trimmer which helps to cut down the hairs which grow in multiple directions. On the other hand, the down side of this shaver is that it is all plastic and very expensive.</p>

<h2>3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005DKKBP6/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="arc5">Panasonic Arc 5</a> &#8211; <strong>Best Electric Razor for Close shaving</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005DKKBP6/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-672 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/panasonic-arc-5-reivew.png" alt="panasonic arc 5 reivew" width="300" height="350" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/panasonic-arc-5-reivew.png 300w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/panasonic-arc-5-reivew-257x300.png 257w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>When it comes to close shaving, no one in the market can beat Panasonic Arc 5. If you are about to return on manual razors, just because your electric shaver is failed to provide you with the close shaving, then give it a try and you will change your decision.</p>
<p>Panasonic is a Japanese brand and compromises nothing over quality. Arc 5 is foil shaver in nature and contains 5 blades which provide extremely close shave. This is the best electric shaver for the people who have thick and heavy beards. There is a LED panel which keeps you updated with the battery life and it also comes with the cleaning and charging dock. Panasonic Arc 5 contains a 14,000 CPM linear motor, which is designed to prevent tugging and pulling which you might have faced in the cheap shavers out there. Just like the Braun, a side trimmer is also available in this electric shaver to help you trimming your mustache and beard.</p>
<p>The shaver contains five foils of 3 different types.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three Slit Foils</strong> are there which helps to cut out all of the long and bulky hairs.</li>
<li><strong>One Lift-Tech trimmer</strong> helps to capture the flat lying hairs and ingrown hairs.</li>
<li><strong>One Finishing foil</strong> is there to cut out all of the hairs which grow in different directions and missed by the other 4 trimmers.</li>
</ul>
<div class="redb">
<p>Everything about this shaver is great. But I couldn&#8217;t find this electric shaver comfortable as compared to others. The head of this shaver feels bulky and big enough. It wasn&#8217;t reaching my neck properly. I got a very sensitive skin and that&#8217;s why I prefer comfortable shavers over close shavers.</p>
<p>If you are getting the desired results already from your current electric shaver and you don&#8217;t have a very thick beard, then I recommend you to not to go with Arc 5. Instead, have a look at Arc 4 below.</p>
</div>
<p>The performance of this electric shaver is absolutely fantastic. There is no doubt that this electric shaver is the best electric shaver, ever built by Panasonic. However, it is missing one of the most important factors &#8220;Comfortability&#8221;. I still want to remind you that this is my personal opinion and I have a sensitive skin and maybe that&#8217;s the reason it didn&#8217;t suit me. This electric shaver might suit you, so you can either go for it or not. It&#8217;s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>It is listed on 3rd number for a reason!</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003V37ZDS/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-686 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Philips-Norelco-Sensotouch-3d-review.png" alt="Philips Norelco Sensotouch 3d review" width="300" height="350" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Philips-Norelco-Sensotouch-3d-review.png 300w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Philips-Norelco-Sensotouch-3d-review-257x300.png 257w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Philips is the master when it comes to Rotary shavers. No other brand can beat Philips in this technology. Number 4 in our list is going to be the rotary shaver Philips Norelco Sensotouch 3D, which is good for both beard and head.</p>
<p>We found this to be the most comfortable rotary shaver and it really sticks with your skin and move smoothly around your face contours and provide efficiently close shave.</p>
<p>The shaver got 3 independent round foils in the head which sticks and moves around the contours of your face. The pivoting head of the shaver helps to reach all of the hairs and stubbles. The foils can spin, tilt and can move upward and downward which is a great feature to help you out in shaving your head. That&#8217;s why this is the best electric shaver for <a href="http://www.menshealth.com/guy-wisdom/bald-doesnt-matter">Bald guys.</a> The head of this shaver is called &#8220;GyroFlex 3D&#8221; because it can move into 3 dimensions which are a unique feature.</p>
<p>There are other amazing features available in this electric shaver is called &#8220;Super Lift&amp;Cut&#8221;, which is similar to ActiveLift in Braun and Lift-Tech in Panasonic. It helps to catch the hairs on neck and jawline. It also helps the shaver to catch in-grown hairs, stubbles, and flat hairs.</p>
<div class="redb">Now let&#8217;s come to the downsides of this shaver. The shaver feels premium from looks but when you get your hands on it, it feels really cheap. Shame it is all plastic and rubber. The battery is fixed, so if somehow your battery goes out of the order, you will have no choice but to replace your electric shaver.</div>
<p>Overall, the SensoTouch 3D is an advanced and great rotary shaver which have all of the latest features you can get from a shaver. It is fast and powerful and provides comfortable and close shave. There are few downsides but it made it the number 4 in our list.</p>

<p>Panasonic yet again, with a marvelous model Arc 4. It is almost same as the Panasonic arc but it contains 4 blades in the head and doesn&#8217;t come with charging dock.</p>
<p>Just like Arc 5, this model will also provide you an extremely close shave but at the same time, it lacks on comfortability.</p>
<p>Panasonic Arc 4 possess all of the features from the latest Arc 5, it is just missing a single trimmer from its head, and it comes without Cleaning and Charging dock. The 4 blade system available in this electric shaver is advanced and sharp enough to provide you the closest shaving experience. The blades are extremely durable, sharp and they can pivot at 30 degrees in any direction. It also contains the linear 14,000 CPM dual action motor which is really powerful.</p>
<p>Other than that, it provides 40 minutes of battery life on a single charge while the others provide 50 minutes of battery backup.</p>
<p>Other then that there is nothing much to write about it as I have already explained all of the features above in <a href="#arc5">Panasonic Arc 5</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FJ2I2O/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-729 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wahl-8061-review.png" alt="wahl 8061 review" width="300" height="350" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wahl-8061-review.png 300w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wahl-8061-review-257x300.png 257w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Wahl is an American brand and a choice of professional barbers. Wahl Professional 8061 is affordable, bump free, powerful and solid electric shaver which can fit the requirements of any man.</p>
<p>This electric shaver uses Dynaflex Cutting system, which can help the shaver to reach and stick to the harder areas like neck and jawline. Dynaflex provides flexibility to the shaver which prevents all type of cuts and burns. Other than that, Hypoallergenic foils are available to provide close and smooth shave. It also provides antimicrobial protection from bacteria.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s why it is an Ideal choice for those who got a very sensitive skin.</strong></p>
<p>The design of this shaver is extremely good. It is designed to be used very easily. It is all plastic but feels premium in hand and you are not paying that much to get an aluminum or metal body. The best thing about this shaver is that it is Hypoallergenic. which is beneficial to the sensitive skin users. There is a pop-up trimmer which can be helpful in trimming mustache and sideburns.</p>
<div class="redb">
<p>You must know before purchasing this shaver, that this is actually a finishing shaver which works for the stubble length hairs only. So if you are going to shave only daily basis, then this is a good choice, else I recommend you to have a look at other shavers available in this list.</p>
<p>Other than that, it vibrates a lot while using, which makes it kinda more difficult to use and uncomfortable.</p>
</div>
<p>Overall, the Wahl Professional 8061 is a great choice for people with sensitive skin becuase of  the hypoallergenic foil heads. It have a long battery life, which is benificial to those who travel a lot. Easy to clean, and easy to use. No doubt, you are getting what you are paying for.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006GQYSGE/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-732 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Philips-norelco-at830.jpg" alt="Philips norelco at830 review" width="300" height="350" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Philips-norelco-at830.jpg 300w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Philips-norelco-at830-257x300.jpg 257w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Philips Norelco AT830 is one of the most famous electric shavers out there and it was first released back in 2012. If you prefer rotary shavers over foil, and short on the budget then AT830 might be an ideal choice for you.</p>
<p>Norelco AT830 is a PowerTouch, Wet &amp; Dry electric shaver which comes with a lot of handy features and very few drawbacks. The head of this shaver can pivot a little but not like the SensoTouch in all of the 3 dimensions. Philips AT830 possess DualPrecision Technology, which allows the head to tackle the long hairs as well as short stubbles, so you can enjoy comfortable and close shaving experience.</p>

<p>Rotary shavers were introduced for comfortable shaving experience. So, no doubt that this shaver provides extremely comfortable shave and really smooth on skin. Just don&#8217;t press the shaver hard on your skin, pretend like you are shaving a tissue paper, AT830 will do the job.</p>
<p>Philips Norelco At830 is mid-level electric shaver which possess a lot of great features including Wet/Dry Technology, DualPrecision, Long lasting battery, Pop-up trimmer and a pivoting head. Other than that, the price is very low as compared to others. <strong>Easy to clean, handsome and a comfortable electric shaver and the most unique part of this shaver is that it is extremely quite.</strong></p>

<h2>8. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CFZJMFM/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="cooltec">Braun CoolTec</a> &#8211; Smooth and Cool Electric Shaver</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CFZJMFM/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-744 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Braun-CoolTec-Review.jpg" alt="Braun CoolTec Review" width="300" height="350" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Braun-CoolTec-Review.jpg 300w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Braun-CoolTec-Review-257x300.jpg 257w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Yet, another shaver from Braun. This time, Braun came up with an amazing sensitive skin specialist that contains TEC (Thermo Electric Cooling) technology.</p>
<p>The Braun CoolTec is a Wet&amp;Dry electric shaver which is good to use either under the shower or on dry skin. It is 100% waterproof, so you can rinse it in water to clean it out.</p>
<p>The unique feature about this shaver is the Cooling Technology. This technology features for the sensitive skins. The electric shaver will keep your skin cool while shaving, so you don&#8217;t have to worry leaving your washroom with a blushing red face. This feature also helps to prevent the irritation while shaving. This feature helps to minimize the burning and redness while shaving.</p>
<p>SensoBlade technology is introduced in this shaver to capture the hairs which grow in different directions. The battery backup of this shaver is 45 minutes and it takes 1 hour to get fully charged. However, if you are going to use the cooling feature, the battery backup will be of 15 minutes on 1 full charge. You can turn the Cooling feature on or off with a single button.</p>
<div class="redb">
<p>I just don&#8217;t want to recommend you to use this electric shaver with gels and foams because of the CoolTec function of this electric shaver. This feature is incompatible with the external cooling fluids.</p>
</div>
<p>Overall, Braun CoolTec is a unique electric shaver which is great in design and comfortability. Comparin price with the other shavers in our list, its nothing. The amazing CoolTec technology makes it a great shaver for people with sensitive skin. The only downside I found in this shaver is the short battery life.<br />

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BB5YHEI/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-750 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Remington-F5-5800-Review.jpg" alt="Remington F5-5800 Review" width="300" height="350" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Remington-F5-5800-Review.jpg 300w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Remington-F5-5800-Review-257x300.jpg 257w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The number 9th is going to be from the famous Remington. Remington is a famous brand which designed lots of entry level to mid range electric shavers. They were first to introduce cordless recharging system for electric shavers.</p>
<p>F5-5800 contains 2 foils and 1 trimmer in the head. The head can pivot upward and downward and it moves around the contours of your face to provide you easy and comfortable shave.</p>
<p>The shaver is very easy to clean. Simply remove the head of the shaver and rinse it under water. The shaver is irritation free. Trust me, I had a lot of irritation even with most of the high-end shavers listed above, including Braun 790cc but Remington F5-5800 was complete irritation free electric shaver.</p>
<div class="redb">The shaver is made up of all cheap plastic. It doesn&#8217;t provide close shaving, for closeness in the budget I recommend you to go with <a href="#arc3">Panasonic Arc 3</a>. The blades required replacement after average use of 3-4 months, which costs additionally. The shavers make a lot of noise because of the motor.</div>
<p>Remington F5-5800 is an affordable and an entry level shaver which provides smooth and comfortable shave. There are few drawbacks which I mentioned above, however, you can buy it under $50. So, those negative points can be ignored.</p>

<p>Last but not least Panasonic Arc 3 is finally here.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter that you are getting a shaver from Panasonic for $30 or $300 or $500, closeness will be their first priority. Yet another electric shaver which provides amazing close shave with 3 blade cutting system and extremely low in price as compared to the most of the electric shavers listed above.</p>
<p>The pivoting head, 3 extremely sharp blades which provide a close shave, LED indicator which keeps you updated with the battery life, Wet&amp;Dry technology, what is not there for you? All of the advanced features are there and the price is under $70.</p>
<p><strong>The shaver comes without cleaning and charging dock, that&#8217;s why the price is low as compared to the other Panasonic models in our list.</strong></p>
<p>The shavers head contains 3 nanotech blades which are also hypoallergenic, so this electric shaver is also sensitive skin friendly. The adjustable pivoting head is there which can stick to your face contours to provide close and smooth shave.</p>
<p>Overall, the Panasonic arc 3 is providing you with a lot of features in very affordable price. It comes without cleaning dock, that&#8217;s how Panasonic manage to keep the price low. But that&#8217;s not a problem, I am sure it&#8217;s not a headache to spend 1 minute more to clean your shaver daily. Other than that, the battery life is great and the shaver does have Wet&amp;Dry Technology, so you can either use it under the shower with foam and gel or you can use it on dry skin.</p>

<h2>Electric Shaver Buyer&#8217;s Guide</h2>
<p>Advanced electric shavers are the combination of technology which comes in a small package. Before choosing your electric shaver either from the list above or somewhere else, I recommend you to still read our Buyer&#8217;s Guide, it will help you to understand the technology that goes with in these modern electric shavers.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let&#8217;s continue with our electric shaver buying guide.</p>
<h3><img class="size-full wp-image-168 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rotary-vs-foil-electric-shaver.jpg" alt="rotary vs foil electric shaver" width="300" height="250" /><a href="http://www.toolsofmen.com/foil-vs-rotary-shaver/">Rotary vs Foil</a> &#8211; Which is best for you?</h3>
<p>I prefer Foil shavers over Rotary shavers because of the closeness, smoothness, and design.</p>
<p>Rotary shavers were introduced first to provide comfortable shaving experience and shaving head. No doubt that rotary shavers are much more comfortable as compared to the foil shavers but they failed to provide a close shave.</p>
<p>Whereas on the other hand, foil shavers are expert in closeness. They contain sharp blades and advanced technology which I really like.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LED Indicator:</strong> A charger with a LED indicator is good enough to keep you updated with the current battery level. Notify you when you plugged in the charger and warn you with the low battery.</li>
<li><strong>Corded and Cordless Shaving:</strong> Few of the electric shavers allow you to shave while your electric shaver plugged in while few doesn&#8217;t. Braun series 9 doesn&#8217;t allow corded shaved while Braun series 7 do allow it.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to use and clean:</strong> Make sure the electric shavers design is easy to use and clean. Almost all of electric shavers listed above are easy to use and easy to clean. Most of the electric shavers above come with Cleaning dock, all you have to do is to put the shaver inside that dock and press the button, that dock will clean your shaver. Some models don&#8217;t come with that cleaning dock, so you have to do it manually. But that won&#8217;t take more than 1 minute!</li>
<li><strong>Pop-up Trimmer:</strong> Most of the shavers come with an integrated trimmer which can be popped up. You can use that trimmer for grooming, sideburns, and mustache.</li>
<li><strong>Wet &amp; Dry Technology:</strong> Wet&amp;Dry technology allows electric shavers to be used either under the shower or on dry skin. If you got a sensitive skin, then you might prefer shaving with gel foam. That&#8217;s where this technology comes handy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, that¡¯s right, this new technology is quickly gaining popularity among artists or other people who are on the lookout to unleash their creativity using the 3D prints.</p>
<p>Before starting the list of Best 3d Pen 2017, I want you to know that what is this new technology?<br />
<a name="what3dpen"></a></p>
<h2>What exactly is a 3D pen?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-471 size-full" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3d-pens-1.jpg" alt="Best 3d Pens 2017" width="800" height="300" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3d-pens-1.jpg 800w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3d-pens-1-300x113.jpg 300w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3d-pens-1-768x288.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>A 3D pen is basically something that looks like a bulkier version of an ordinary pen or a pencil, however, instead of using the traditional lead or ink that is used in pencils or pen, the 3D printing pen operates using plastic. Yes, you¡¯ve heard it.</p>
<p>Now it¡¯s safe to say that there are a lot of questions roaming in your head about how difficult it is to use or is it even a good thing. Well, yes; first of all, using this pen is no different than using a normal pen or a pencil, you get to hold it the same way you hold the other aforementioned instruments, and yes, there are a lot of ways one can use a 3D pen.<br />

<h2>How does a 3d Printing Pen Work?</h2>
<div class="redb"><strong>Before we begin exploring more about 3D pens, let¡¯s just clarify one thing; these instruments are nowhere associated with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?field-keywords=3d+printers&amp;tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">3D printers</a>.</strong></div>
<figure id="attachment_446" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017X3Y976/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="wp-image-446 size-full" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3D-Pen-Filament-Refills.jpg" alt="3D Pen Filament Refills" width="300" height="250" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Plastic Filaments</figcaption></figure>
<p>A 3D pen basically uses plastic instead of ink, you insert the plastic filament at one, and once it¡¯s inside the pen, it gets heated using some sort of heating technology inside, the heat is strong enough to melt the plastic, and turn it into a liquid, once that¡¯s done, you can start using the pen to write on pretty much everything you want; the good thing about a 3D pen is that it works on almost all the surfaces.</p>
<p>If you are in awe, then don¡¯t worry, we have seen similar technology like this known as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGeujbfgEI8">glue gun</a>, which works on almost the same principle as a 3D pen does. 3D pens basically come in several different colors in order to truly bring out the artist inside you.</p>
<p>If you are wondering what you can do with a 3D pen, the possibilities are limitless to be honest, where the drawings that you usually create using the ordinary pen and pencil are two dimensional, the 3D pens can add another dimension and make your drawings and artwork extra realistic. With that out of the way, even though these 3D pens are relatively new on the market, the market is quite saturated, this means that there are hundreds of choices, and if you are someone who is relatively inexperienced in this field, then you might have a really hard time finding the best 3D pen on the market.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.idevaffiliate.com/33268/101.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-1165 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/3D-Simo-Review.jpg" alt="3D Simo Review" width="300" height="250" /></a>The 3D pen we have with us right now just maybe the most revolutionary 3D pen there is. You should know that the 3D Simo mini first appeared in a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/3dsimo-mini/3dsimo-mini-make-your-vision-come-true" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> in order to get the project going, and while it seemed too ambitious and too innovative for its own good, the pen managed to get a lot of attention as well as financial backing.</p>
<p>Today, the 3D Simo Mini has finally become a reality, and people who are willing to try it out can do so by simply pre-ordering it. With that said, the company was nice enough to send us a review sample, and we finally unwrapped it to see what¡¯s so special about the 3D pen, and in all honesty, we were blown away by the amount of top of the line features that have been put into the 3D Simo.</p>
<p>For starters, you should know that it¡¯s not just a 3D pen, you see, the pen itself comes with a number of attachments that you can use in order to make it multi-purpose. In case you don¡¯t know, the 3D Simo is 3D pen that can easily be turned into a soldering machine as well as a cutter, and something of a lighter. Yes, you¡¯ve heard it. You get all these attachments supplied with the pen itself so you don¡¯t have to go out and spend extra on these.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering, you can always take a look at the pen in action by simply watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QPZRBrAbpE" target="_blank">Christmas Commercial Video</a>.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>Other than that, there are a lot of other things about the 3D Simo pen that a lot of people don¡¯t know about, for starters, like we stated earlier, the attachments you get can basically be used for purposes of foam cutting, burning, as well as soldering.</p>
<p>You can use these attachments on a number of different materials such as wood, metal, as well as all the other materials that normally are supposed to work with the 3D pen. With that said, you don¡¯t know the best thing about the 3D Simo pen, this pen comes with a feature that isn¡¯t available in any other 3D pen in the market, so we can say that the 3D Simo managed to revolutionize the 3D pen industry. The 3D Simo comes with an iOS, Android, and Windows Phone app that you can use to control some of the basic functionalities of the 3D pen itself. In case you are wondering what can be, and cannot be controlled, you can choose profiles, along with some other options such as watching tutorial videos.</p>
</div>
<p>All the filaments were provided to us so we can do a proper evaluation of this amazing 3D pen. The filaments were PLA, ABS, as well as metal filaments. As for the attachments, they can be attached using the magnet.</p>

<h2>2. <a href="http://buy.lixpen.com?rfsn=300703.7731a" rel="nofollow" name="lix">Lix 3D Smart Pen</a> &#8211; Most Smallest and Smartest 3D Pen out there</h2>
<div class="redb"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Lot of consumers having hard time with this 3d pen but we had no issue at all while reviewing it. Anyhow, we are going to give it a try again to ensure that the pen is still the one, they send us for reviewing purposes. Till then, we don&#8217;t recommend you guys to buy this 3d pen.</div>
<p><a href="http://buy.lixpen.com?rfsn=300703.7731a" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-460" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Lix-3D-Printing-Pen.jpg" alt="Lix 3D Printing Pen Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>Lix took the world by surprise when the announced the world¡¯s smallest 3D printing pen, as opposed to the first 3D printing pen as well as the others in the market, the Lix 3D printing pen proved to be a wonder for both the consumers and the critics alike. The pen tore through its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lix3d/lix-the-smallest-3d-printing-pen-in-the-world/description">Kickstarter campaign</a> and was finally available for the consumers to buy. We were lucky enough to get our hands on a review unit of this amazing 3D printing pen. Our impressions about this pocket-sized powerhouse? Let¡¯s find out.</p>
<p>Like we stated earlier, the Lix 3D is perhaps the smallest 3D printing pen available in the market, but how does it perform? Well, you¡¯d be surprised; the pen proved to be pretty much amazing in all the tests we have done. We conducted different tests including using this pen in a complete pin drop silent environment to test out if it has any of the issues that plague other 3D pens, to our surprise, this is perhaps one of the most quite 3D pens we have had the pleasure to use. With that said, the build quality of this 3D pen is really top notch, and it works brilliantly on almost all the surfaces we have tested on without any hiccups.</p>
<p>Another great thing about this 3D pen is that it is powered via a USB cable, this is really a big advantage considering how most of the 3D pen we have used required power through a power brick, which needed to be plugged into an outlet. However, you can use the Lix 3D printing pen without all that hassle, it can power up as long as it has a power source to power it up, you can even use a power bank to use it. Super simple.</p>
<p>If you are wondering whether or not this pen has any cons, then you¡¯d be surprised to know that during our testing, we failed to find anything bad about this. The only thing we have to say about Lix 3D printing pen is how amazing it at the tasks it is supposed to handle. With that said, if you are in the market for a 3D printing pen that looks good and performs good, then you have a winner at your hand.</p>

<p>The first on the list is the Scribbler V3, and as the name may suggest, it is an updated version of the legacy Scribbler Pen, this pen has been in the market for quite some time and is taking people by surprise. Perhaps one of the best features about this pen is the amazing build quality and perfect ergonomics that make this pen such a breeze to use. With that said, let¡¯s find out some details about how good this pen is.</p>
<p>For starters, the pen comes in various different colors, but don¡¯t worry, you can actually use filaments of different colors with the pen. As of now, the 3D pen is available in a total number of 8 colors, the available colors are Blue, Green, Purple, Red, White, and Yellow.</p>
<p>In our testing, it was revealed that the pen is extremely light weight and highly easy to operate, and if you are having concerns about how easy it is to change the filament, then don¡¯t, the pen operates in a rather easy and friendly manner that allows you to operate it without any hassle.</p>
<p><strong>See, how you can be awesome with the Scribbler Pen</strong> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="??" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>To be very honest, the Scribbler 3D Pen V3 didn¡¯t really have any major downsides to begin with, all the tests were passed with flying colours, however, for people who are used to the traditional way of drawing using a pen or a pencil might have some issues drawing with this pen at first because like all 3D pens, this one has a learning curve. Rest assured, this is without a shadow of a doubt, an amazing pen.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S4CJWVE/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-461" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/7TECH-3D-Printing-Pen-Review.jpg" alt="7TECH 3D Printing Pen Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The next up on our list is the 7TECH 3D Printing Pen. This specific 3D printing pen was designed with only one purpose in mind; the easy to use, user-friendly nature. With that said, the company behind this amazing 3D printing pen ensured us that the product will have an incredibly silent operating mode, in addition to that, the pen also comes with several features that make this 3D printing pen, one of the best we have seen. Let¡¯s find out more about it.</p>
<p>The 7TECH 3D printing pen has some advanced features that are welcomed additions, for instance, this 3D printing pen comes with one of the best thermal control, in addition to that, the 3D printing pen also manages to notify you about the filament getting stuck. Last but not the least, in case you hate the super-fast or super-slow extrusion of many 3D pens, you don¡¯t have to worry about this one as it actually lets you control the extrusion according to your own preferred speed.</p>
<p>The only 2 issues we actually encountered during our review and testing were the lack of supplied filaments as well as how hot the pen can get while it¡¯s fully operational. Do keep in mind that while you are operating the pen, the temperature can go incredibly high, and to an extent that it may cause damage to your skin if you get In contact with it. With that said, we also realized that the supplied filament wasn&#8217;t enough, but then again, companies through these in for the royalty. With that said, the 7TECH 3D Printing Pen is one of the finest 3D printing pens we have used and is certainly one of the top 3D pens.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B016QGM5Q8/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-462" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ccbetter-Intelligent.jpg" alt="ccbetter Intelligent 3d pen Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>The fourth on our list is the ccbetter Intelligent 3D Pen before we go into details, you should know that this pen is also sold under a different name that is called Joyluxy Intelligent 3D. With that said, the Intelligent 3D pen is one of the best 3D pens 2017 we have had the pleasure of reviewing. Speaking of functions and features, the 3D pen is quite basic and has all the necessities anyone would want in a 3D pen. With that out of the question, let¡¯s take a closer, and proper look at the CCbetter Intelligent 3D pen from Joyluxy.</p>
<p>The pen comes in a sleek-looking box that is no bigger than your usual smartphone box, inside the box, you find the usual power brick along with the 2 supplied filaments. Do keep in mind that you can always purchase separate filaments of your own choice, the manufacturer was nice enough to include a stand that you can use to put your pen on when it is not in use. The 3D printing pen was rather easy to use for both the newcomers as well as veteran artists, the testing revealed that it managed to work on almost all the major materials with great ease and consistently gave us brilliant results. The pen also comes with an OLED that has a small status indicator that tells you when the filament is heated and ready to use, quite a nice tough to be honest.</p>
<p>Speaking of cons, the thorough and concise testing didn¡¯t really reveal any issues to begin with, however, we would have liked a bit more detailed instruction guide, especially for people who are reluctant when it comes to using such stuff without the proper guide to help them out. Apart from that, the pen managed to perform excellently in all the tests.</p>
<p>With that said, the CCBetter Intelligent 3D Pen from Joyluxy is probably one of our most favourite 3D pens we have used, and is a definite recommendation for someone who¡¯s looking for the best bang for the buck.</p>

Before you say anything about the name, try and think about the saying that goes like ¡°do not judge a book by its cover¡±, with that said, the Lay3r 3D pen took us be surprised as we weren¡¯t expecting something so amazing. How is it amazing? Well, there¡¯s only one way to find out. Let¡¯s see.</p>
<p>As compared to the other 3D printing pens we have used and reviewed, the Lay3r 3D pen is oddly large, however, as big as it may seem, the 3D pen proved to be extremely good at handling and not heavy at all.</p>
<p>Another great advantage of the Lay3r 3D pen is that it is really easy to use. How easy, you ask? With proper guidance, a 12-year-old can use the pen without making any mistakes. However, the great thing about it is that it doesn¡¯t matter if a kid is using this amazing pen or some veteran artist is, the pen is extremely easy to handle for people of all age and skill level.</p>
<p>We were surprised to see that the company has included a fan inside the pen to make sure it stays cool during the hot operating temperature, last but not the least, the pen comes with an automatic shutdown feature that turns off the pen when it¡¯s not being operated.</p>
<p>As for the downsides, the only downside we actually think exists is the size of the pen, but then again, considering how it has a fan built inside of it, the size can be justified.</p>

<p>The next product on our list is the GENESIS 3D Pen, for those who don¡¯t know, the company is also known for creating a really popular 3D printer. The company behind Genesis 3D pen is known as Lasso Labs and today we are bringing you this brilliant 3D pen. Let¡¯s see how it manages to fair against the tough competition that is currently existing because of the saturated market of 3D printing pens.</p>
<p>The Genesis 3D pen is nicely designed and looks quite sophisticated, it¡¯s nowhere near as slim and small as the Lix 3D printing pen but when it comes to doing the job, it isn¡¯t any less than the competition. Our review unit came in all black, however, there are a few other color combinations available. The pen managed to perform eloquently in all the tests; it was smooth, the plastic filament didn¡¯t get stuck, and the pen¡¯s chassis didn¡¯t get abnormally hot ¨C something that is common with a lot of 3D pens. Lasso Labs was also kind enough to add in 5 filaments in the box, and you can always purchase the filaments separately. With that said, the Genesis 3D pen pleased us with the consistent performance and a minimal learning curve.</p>
<p>Moving on to the complaints, we don¡¯t really have any. The only 3D pen managed to perform perfectly fine in almost all the situations and didn¡¯t disappoint us at all.</p>

<p>The next one in the list is 3Doodler 3D printing pen. This stylish pen comes with 50, yes, you have heard it, 50 plastic filaments &#8212; the most number of filaments we have received with a 3D printing pen. The overall looks and feels of the pen are amazing, and the color (black) we received for reviewing made the pen look like something that came out from a Tom Clancy novel. With that said, let¡¯s see if the pen is worth the $110 price tag. However, before we begin, you should know this pen is in no way related to another product that goes by the same name and is also known as the first 3D printing pen in the world.</p>
<p>This is perhaps one of the best-looking 3D printing pens available in the market, right next to the Lix 3D printing pen we have reviewed earlier, the greatest thing about this pen is that it comes with 50 filaments, and they are extremely easy to replace and do not get clogged. The testing phase revealed that the pen manages to work perfectly fine on almost all the surfaces. The pen happens to be really easy to use, especially for the veteran artists who have good experience with drawing and using such tools, as for newcomers, there is a slight learning curve for them.</p>
<p>In all honesty, we didn¡¯t find any cons at all. There were some concerns, but pointing them out would be nitpicking as almost all the 3D pens we have reviewed had them with the exception of Lix 3D printing pen.</p>

<p>Our next entry is the Glyby Intelligent 3D printing pen. Reviewers and users have hailed it as one of the best 3D printing pens ever available, and sure, it is nowhere near good looking as the Lix 3D printing pen, but in terms of functionality, the pen manages to perform quite well. How well, you ask? Well, let¡¯s find out, shall we?</p>
<p>The Glyby Intelligent 3D printing pen is perhaps the cheapest 3D printing pen available in the market, it retails for just $50 and in terms of performance, it manages to give a groundbreaking performance and works on almost all the surfaces. With that said, do keep in mind that this 3D printing pen is made with kids in mind, so if you want something for some extra professional work, you probably might want to spend your money somewhere else, and on something more expensive that would be more appropriate for the professional work. Moving on, the pen is easy to use for kids, it has enough features to keep them happy for a long time, and as long as they operate under a proper supervision, things won¡¯t go wrong.</p>
<p>At the given price, there isn¡¯t anything to complain about the Glyby Intelligent 3D printing pen, the main purpose of this 3D printing pen is to make sure that the children can developer their minds properly, and it does a great job at that. Sure there are better 3D printing pens available in the market, but do keep in mind that they are usually above $90. With that said, the Glyby 3D printing pen is an amazing gift for kids who are always up for learning new, interesting and soulful things.</p>

<p>We are bringing something extraordinary for you, just like the Lix 3D printing pen, the CreoPop 3D cordless printing pen is a revolution on its own. What¡¯s good about it? It doesn&#8217;t require a wire to work, which means that there is an insane amount of portability that comes with this 3D printing pen, and if you want more cool things from this pen then here¡¯s another surprise; unlike the rest of the 3D printing pens, this one doesn¡¯t have any heating parts. Yes, you have heard it, this pen uses plastic without even heating and melting it.</p>
<p>As compared to the other pens that use thermoplastics, the CreoPop uses photopolymers, this is the type of ink that starts liquefying as soon as it is exposed to LED diodes. With that said, let¡¯s find out more about the pen itself. Considering how there is no heated, melting plastic involved, the pen is extremely easy to use and completely safe for children as there won¡¯t be accidental burns. The testing revealed that despite a completely different ink, pen managed to perform excellently in almost all the tests despite having a completely different type of ink.</p>
<p>Coming to the cons, or things we didn¡¯t like about the pen, to be honest, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. If you want something that is futuristic, easy to use, and fancy, then you should definitely get this one. The only concern we have is that currently, the ink is supplied only by one company, and that might be a problem for some people as other pens can pretty much use any plastic filament available in the market. With that out of the way, the CreoPop 3D Cordless Printing Pen is amazing and one of a kind that will make any art lover happy.</p>

<h2><a name="buyerg"></a>3d Pen Buyer&#8217;s Guide</h2>
<p>Before buying a 3D pen, you must familiarize with its functioning and applications. The modus operandi is different with each brand. Between filament and design, there can be tons of variables. Newest 3D pen products may not share the same design as the world¡¯s first 3Doodler model. 3Doodler for instance, uses plastic filament, thus making it easy to draw in the air. Real-time creation of 3D objects in serious pace was a real prospect. 3D pens don¡¯t have a long history.</p>
<p>The very first project of its kind was funded as a kick starter product.  So, you wouldn¡¯t have too many variables to know about, in order to master 3D pen technology. The success of 3Doodler inspired another gem of a product in Scribbler. With productions in China, Scribbler was still able to deliver with 6-month warranty plus return policy. Some unattended promises such as Lix tiny 3D pen still work under progress for years now. If you don¡¯t know how to go about choosing your 3D pen, this can be trickiest of markets.</p>
<p>3D technology takes large steps as we speak. Nevertheless, there isn¡¯t too much to learn about, in comparison to typical household electronics. Getting a grasp of this technology can be real easy. Evolution of this technology can be explained quickly by comparing plastic and cool ink pens.</p>
<h3>3D plastic pen vs. Cool Ink pen</h3>
<p>3Doodler and Scribbler accounted for most products of 3D printing pens in the initial stage of 3D pens market. All of them used plastic for drawing 3D objects in the air. The successive development took place in the form of cool ink pens. They made drawing in 3D as possible as it was in the case of plastic pens. The added advantage to it was the riddance of hot parts. Without hot components, it was a safer option for all age groups, especially kids. Since September 2015, cool ink pen models were released and competed for market share.</p>
<p>First, few cool ink pens such as the 3D Creation Maker didn¡¯t provide users with an option of drawing in air. The drawing happens on a horizontal surface and the art is hardened later. It didn¡¯t match the feel of drawing in the air. During November last year, products like CreoPop came up with a solution. They put UV to use, thereby making drawing in the air possible. The plastic pens vs. cool ink pens sum up the evolution of 3D printing pens.</p>
<h3>Additional Features</h3>
<p>The first and foremost function of 3D pens are to draw 3D art or objects. The functioning and design would facilitate filament loading, filament conversion and draw process. Additionally, some extra features can come to rescue, when needed the most. Standby mode would be a classic example of the useful additional feature. Large LCD screens can give a product an edge over competitors. Some products even have filament jamming detection system. Smart 3D pens come with extreme options like thermal management, working LED etc..</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type of control</strong>: Quality of 3D pen can be boosted with the extra bit of control it gives the user. For instance, the temperature can be controlled in plastic 3D pens. You can also control the speed of drawing in few products. The adjustable feed can help regulate flow and speed of drawing. Continuous speed regulation elevates your comfort and ease of drawing. Adjustable temperature can help fine tune your drawings to levels you didn¡¯t know existed. It changes the entire 3D art experience. Intelligent controls are what the new millennium product needs, to create massive appeal.</li>
<li><strong>Design</strong>: Ergonomic design is the need of the hour when it comes to 3D pens of now. Many promises haven¡¯t been delivered, including the tiny 3D pen from Lix. Slimmer 3D pens are what that¡¯s preferred in current market scenario. Best products are super small and can be recharged even through laptop USB. Design plays a huge role in how easy controls feel on your hand.  The design should allow easy access to display. Your view should flow seamlessly from filament to dropping ink or plastic. Light weight and ergonomic design would enhance the quality of 3D pen any day.</li>
<li><strong>Filament type</strong>: Type of filament would have a say in your drawing style. It determines how you hold the pen and which grip you would be getting. Filament contains the plastic element, which enables drawing. At this point in time, there are more than a dozen different filament types available in the market. As a rule of thumb, the easier it is to replace, the better it is for use. Easily replaceable filament type helps a great deal in the long run. It makes your 3D pen usable for a long time. There are 4 major categories in filaments ¨C Standard, Flexible, Composite, and Specialty.</li>
<li><strong>Brand name</strong>: Brand name definitely matters in this young technology. 3Doodler invented the world¡¯s first 3D printing pen. Scribbler offers the luxury of 6-month warranty. The catch would its production model based in China. Brands like Lix are proven to be innovative. Every brand makes users come up with few realistic expectations. Compare brands and models on the basis of quality and features available. False marketing is what you would commonly see in this category of products. It would be your responsibility to examine the brand and know what to expect.</li>
<li><strong>Check Reviews</strong>: Word of mouth wouldn¡¯t work for 3D pens on reputation or marketing front. Every 3D printing pen artists would be first generation users. You got to trust internet reviews and marketing claims. Read customer reviews across different and shopping site. Beware of fabricated reviews and spot them when things look too good to be true. It is the easiest way to determine quality and worth of your product. Reviews would be the first-hand information you need before deciding if the product would work or not. A lot of 3D printing pen models made promises which were never delivered. Dig more for video reviews on YouTube. This way, you can see for yourself, how these pens work.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion &#8211; Wrapping it up</h2>
<p>Right now, buying a 3D printer is a simple equivalent of spending an awful lot of money. Yes, a 3D printer makes sense if you have to undertake large projects that are simply not possible on a 3D printing pen.</p>
<p>However, if you want a 3D printing pen for doing a small exhibition or school projects than it is more than an adequate choice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the market is relatively new, but the choices are quite a lot, that¡¯s why this list was made. In order to assist interested consumers in picking the best possible 3D printing pen.</p>

<p><strong>If you are in a hurry, then simply have a look at two of these models below.</strong></p>
<p>One is the best for professionals and expensive as compared to others and the other one is the best crossbow for beginners or entry-level users and of course budget friendly.</p>

<h2>1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IFWHWTC/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="MatrixMega">Excalibur Matrix Mega 405 Review</a> &#8211; Best crossbow for the money</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IFWHWTC/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="alignright wp-image-1128 size-full" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Excalibur-Matrix-Mega-405-Review.jpg" alt="Excalibur Matrix Mega 405 Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>This crossbow is quite expensive but it¡¯s worth it.</p>
<p>This type of a recurve crossbow is the fastest one available in the stores. Pros can hit up to 405 FPS and more allow it to make its mark.</p>
<p>Carrying it around is not a problem because just like all the other recurve crossbows it is light. The scope is none other than the most expensive scope; Twilight DLX scope and it goes without saying that it adds up the accuracy of the crossbow.</p>
<p>It is definitely not easy to use hence a lot of features for safety are included. With a speed of approximately 405 fps, it is one of the fastest bows on the market.</p>
<div class="yb">Another advantage of having this crossbow is that it has one of the best scopes that can accurately zoom in on the target without any fuss at all. To help you focus, one of the best features is a built-in R.E.D.S suppressors that help reduce the noise of the crossbow.</div>
<p>With a draw weight of about 290 lbs, it is however not a favorable crossbow. Usually, the users prefer crossbows with a shorter pull length that consumes a lot less energy and helps release the arrow at full speed. Mostly longer pulls mean faster the speed and this is the case with this crossbow but users do not prefer having crossbows with a long pull length.</p>
<div class="redb">
<p>The bow stringer is not a part of this crossbow which is another let down for the users.</p>
</div>
<div id="visualizer-1109-88180310" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-1109"></div>
<div class="blueb">
<p>Overall this crossbow can not only be used for target shooting but also big game hunting. The assembly of the crossbow is made easy with a DVD manual that helps you watch and assemble the crossbow. It takes less than 30 minutes to assemble the crossbow and test it.</p>
<p>The adjustment of scope can make shooting and hit the target easily and one has to learn how to adjust it to make that happen. Another advantage of using this crossbow is that it is a lot less noisy than all the other crossbows and a lot more powerful.</p>
<p>4 Diablo arrows come with this arrow which works like a charm.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IRJDZHG/?tag=10beasts-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img class="size-full wp-image-874 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TenPoint-Venom-Crossbow-Review.jpg" alt="TenPoint Venom Crossbow Review" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>TenPoint Venom also has one of the best scopes that improves the accuracy of spotting a target. This crossbow is best for both, Professionals and Beginners. Assembling this crossbow is extremely easy.</p>
<p>If cocking the bow is a problem then the advantage of using this bow becomes quite clear as it has a built-in rope cocking feature. Hunting bear, moose, and deer are quite easy using this crossbow. Mostly all the Tenpoint gadgets have an exceptional performance.</p>
<p>The scope is already focused so, after fixing it, not much adjustment is required to start using it. The power of this crossbow is estimated by the weight of the arrows used.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>Its structure and shape allow users to move through narrow areas with ease. Hunting is made easier because of its light weight which is another plus for this crossbow.</p>
<p>The piercing power of the arrow is lethal and can move through thickest of objects with ease. 20-inch arrows are preferred for this crossbow and there are specially designed <a href="http://www.tenpointcrossbows.com/shop/Pro-Elite-Carbon-Crossbow-Arrows-P25.aspx" target="_blank">Pro Elite Arrows</a> for this crossbow. The flight of these arrows is linear and swift and they last longer. Carrying these arrows with you is easier as well.</p>
</div>
<p>TenPoint offers a constrained lifetime guarantee on the majority of its products including crossbows, yet you should complete the process of the warranty card and give it back in 30 days of buying the crossbow to enact the warranty.</p>
<p>The multi-layered optics amplify and zoom in from 1.5X to 5X, and the transmission of light on this degree is completely amazing. Each shot is swift just like the flight of the arrow, and the scope is generally as accurate in low-light as well as bright conditions. The scope aims effectively and remains constant even after a considerable measure of knocking and jerking movements.</p>
<p><strong>With this crossbow, you won&#8217;t have to supplant the scope with any other in the market.</strong></p>
<div id="visualizer-1108-1110988152" class="visualizer-front  visualizer-front-1108"></div>
<div class="redb">
<p><strong>This crossbow, however, offers fewer features compared to other crossbows in the market.</strong></p>
<p>Compared to the cost it should offer more features and hence being costly than most of the crossbows it does not satisfy the users when it comes to the features it offers. The clicks of the safety might distract the user even though the suppressors reduce the noise of the crossbow.</p>

<p>Here comes another crossbow all the way from Barnett. Penetrator is super easy to assemble and come with all of the necessary tools, so you can start your practice right away.</p>
<p>Penetrator can shoot arrows at the maximum speed of 350 fps, which can provide 109 ft./lbs of kinetic energy to those arrows. So, the arrows can go deep inside your target.</p>
<p>It is much more for a small and medium-to-large level games.</p>
<div class="redb"><strong>The string of this crossbow is not so good. After a few shots, the string snapped, and I had to replace it. String failures are not included in the Barnett&#8217;s Warranty Coverage so that new string cost me extra.</strong></div>

<ul>
<li>5 years of warranty which covers the stock, limb assembly and trigger mechanism.</li>

</ul>
<div class="blueb">Barnett penetrator come in a handsome budget and provide years of service. You can easily kill a deer with it and after some experience, elk hunts will be possible too.

<h2><a name="guide"></a>Crossbow Buying Guide</h2>
<p>As it has always been mentioned in the reviews that before spending money on a crossbow make sure it is compatible with your needs.</p>
<div class="yb">
<p>The overall selection of the crossbows is based on several factors that include</p>
<div class="su-list su-list-style-">
<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The draw weight of the bow</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The speed of the arrow</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> The scope</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>If all these factors are satisfactory, then the user considers the bow for purchasing. The buyer also has to be aware of the fact that the accessories that come with the package are quite important like the rope cocking device and padded slinger.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The draw weight</strong> which means that the power that is required to pull the arrow before the flight. Mostly the bigger the draw weight the faster the speed of the arrow and more power it would have. It is between 75 to 200 pounds.</li>
<li><strong>The minimum speed</strong> with which the arrow should travel is 300 FPS. This means that not only the bows with more draw weight and light bow weight are preferred but also the ones that shoot arrows at a faster speed. Large hunting games prefer such speeds and killing the prey with one shot is not a problem with such a speed. This speed also improves the power with which the bolt hits the target and that is also a very important factor in hunting.</li>
<li><strong>Having a good scope</strong> usually, means that you can have a good distance from the target but also hit a lethal blow with one shot. That also, however, depends on the power with which the arrow is shot and how light the bow is.</li>
</ul>
<div class="redb">
<h4>Shooting Experience with Excalibur Matrix 405<br />
Why is that our #1 Crossbow?</h4>
<p>The scope zooms in on the target and with the help of the red dot the target is easily spotted and so is the region that has to be hit. Once the arrow is loaded and shot the quality and speed of the arrow determine the end result. The professional choice keeping in view these factors would be <a href="#MatrixMega">Excalibur Matrix 405</a> that is quite powerful and shoots arrows at a speed of 405 FPS which is exceptional.</p>
<p>The noise suppressors reduce the noise made by the bow whereas a draw weight of 290 lbs gives it an exceptional power that could pierce a hole through a sturdy body in a matter of seconds. This bow is however made for the professionals who compete and win.</p>
</div>
<div class="blueb">
<h4>My Personal Choice &#8211; Why I like Barnett Ghost 410?</h4>
<p>The editor¡¯s choice is Barnett Ghost 410 that has a shooting speed of 410 FPS and can be handled by the beginners as well as the professionals.</p>
<p>The noise suppressors are not included however which makes this bow quite noisy. Other than that the fact that this bow is for all kinds of users, makes it a great choice and a good candidate.</p>
</div>
<h4>Other facts one must be aware of</h4>
<ul>
<li>The bow users also have to be aware of the fact that whenever the bow has to be loaded the wax has to be applied on the string to make the cord last longer.</li>
<li>Pulling the string without loading the arrow can cause serious damage to the bow.</li>
<li>The bow has to be light so that it could be carried around easily and mostly the arrows do not have to be heavy enough as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important that the user knows how to adjust the scope before using the bow. The manual with the package helps the users not only assemble the parts of the bow but also come with the instructions that prove to be quite useful.</p>
<p>Most of the users are fresh and have to learn how to use a bow and the manual helps such users feel easy with the new bow. The durability is also another factor and it is considered to be important but it also depends on the user that how he handles the bow that is given to him. The proper usage of the bow will make the bow last longer.</p>

<p><strong>Protective Case</strong> &#8211; The first accessory I always buy when I upgrade my iPhone is a new protective case. I think protective cases are the best iPhone accessories because they save you hundreds of dollars almost every time you drop your device.</p>
<p>I always choose a slim fit case. It&#8217;s very cheap, looks good on the iPhone design and most important protect your device from drops.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth Headphones</strong> &#8211; The second accessory you should have with your iPhone are a pair of Bluetooth headphones.</p>
<p>If you are a tech geek, then you should know that Bluetooth headphones are the future. Wired headphones are quickly going out of the market, especially with the Apple&#8217;s new iPhone 7 device.</p>
<p>I use Wireless Beats by Dre headphones, and I love them. They sound good, are very stylish and quick to setup.</p>
<p><strong>Portable Charger</strong> &#8211; I use my iPhone a lot, and by a lot, I mean about 6 hours screen time. With such heavy usage, the battery runs out very quickly. That&#8217;s why I always hold a portable battery charger on my backpack. It is a must-have accessory, and they are very cheap.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to go for a 10,000 mAh external battery, but a 3,000 mAh capacity external charger can charge your iPhone battery twice so that It would be enough for an average user.</p>
<h3><img class="size-full wp-image-1183 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Josiah-Nelson.jpg" alt="Josiah Nelson" width="250" height="250" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Josiah-Nelson.jpg 250w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Josiah-Nelson-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" />Josiah Nelson &#8211; <a href="https://www.primevox.net/" name="josi">Primevox</a></h3>
<p>First I would say it&#8217;s going to depend on what you use your phone for most. However, 3 of the best general accessories I can think of that would apply to most people are a tempered glass screen protector, an external flash drive with lightning and a battery pack.</p>
<p><strong>Tempered glass screen protector</strong> &#8211; It is probably my favorite thing ever. It&#8217;s like a bulletproof vest for your screen. I can&#8217;t say how many times those have saved hundreds in repairs and there&#8217;s virtually no downside. I now put a tempered glass screen protector on every repair I do, and people love them.</p>
<p><strong>Flash Drive</strong> &#8211; It may not fit everybody&#8217;s needs, but if you got the 16GB phone (which winds up being more like 11GB), or use a lot of storage, it&#8217;s a must. I use mine daily to be able to keep files off my phone, and it makes transferring data that much easier as I don&#8217;t need to have a lightning cable to move data at work.</p>
<p><strong>Battery Pack</strong> &#8211; These things have saved my ass more than a few times. I have a 24000MAh battery pack, and it will charge my phone dead to full about six times. These are especially necessary if you&#8217;re one of the unlucky 6S owners whose phone dies at 35% after the 10.1 update. Regardless, though, I never leave home without mine.</p>
<h3><img class="size-full wp-image-1237 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/James-Goodnow.jpg" alt="James Goodnow" width="250" height="250" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/James-Goodnow.jpg 250w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/James-Goodnow-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" />James Goodnow &#8211; <a href="https://lambergoodnow.com/tech/james-goodnow/" name="jamess">LamberGoodNow</a></h3>
<p><strong>A case</strong> &#8211; Protect your phone. iPhones are at least $500, so spend $10 and get a good case.</p>
<p><strong>Apple AirPods</strong> &#8211; Truly wireless earbuds. No wires and excellent battery life. The future is wireless, so embrace it now.</p>
<p><strong>A car charger</strong> &#8211; Keep a good one handy in your car to get a little extra juice on the ride in or home from work.</p>
<p>Nothing is more frustrating than needing to charge your phone and having to wait until you get home. It could also be a safety concern if something happened.</p>

<p>As iPhones have evolved so have their accessories; but unlike the smartphone behemoth, accessory manufacturers don¡¯t have as much dominance in the market.</p>
<p>This is because it¡¯s so competitive and diluted with similar gadgets and gizmos that do the same thing. So to help you decide which accessories are worth purchasing and which are worth avoiding, here are my top 3 favorite iPhone accessories on the market today.</p>
<p><strong>Belkin Lightning Audio + Charge RockStar</strong> &#8211; If you¡¯ve got an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, you¡¯ll understand the hardship of not having a headphone jack anymore. This simple but crucial adapter enables the latest iPhone users to charge their device while listening to headphones without having to purchase Apple¡¯s wireless AirPods.</p>
<p><strong>Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector</strong> &#8211; People hate using screen protectors because they make their smartphone&#8217;s display feel cheap and ugly. That being said, I¡¯ve been using this particular tempered glass screen protector on my iPhone 6 Plus since buying the phone in 2014, and it¡¯s as good as new.</p>
<p>Because of the glass texture and clarity of the screen protector, I forget I¡¯m even using this accessory! If you want your device to look good and avoid scratches, this product is a must.</p>

<p><strong>My OtterBox case</strong> is my #1 go-to for cases. It can take a beating and protects my phone from everyday wear and tear.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also a big fan of <strong>Incipio&#8217;s charging cables.</strong> They have 2-meter-long ones that are perfect for when you need to be a little mobile while still charging.</p>
<p>That being said, I also love <strong>Eton&#8217;s Boost Turbine Charger.</strong> Not only can you plug your phone into this and charge it, but it has a crank that lets you manually charge up your charger when it runs low.</p>

<p><strong>iPad earphones</strong> &#8211; I am amazed by the sound quality. These earphones are my best partner when I want to cut off from the world and sail in the sea of sound. The complexity cancels the external noise which helps me listen to every beat of the songs.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone leather case</strong> &#8211; although there are many designs available, I prefer the traditional black leather case which makes my phone look sleek and stylish.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone screen protector</strong> &#8211; when it comes to durability and longevity if screen guard I trust only iPhone flagship products. My phone had been manhandled and has been dropped many times but thanks to the iPhone screen protector my screen is safe and crystal clear</p>

<p>My top 3 recommended iPhone accessories are:</p>
<p><strong>Olloclip Active Lens Set</strong> &#8211; By far this is the best attachment lens right now providing both wide and 2x telephoto. The lens set greatly extends the reach of your iPhone lens, especially if you have the dual lens of the 7 plus.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Watch 2</strong> &#8211; The iPhone and the Apple Watch 2 are like peanut butter and jelly, apple and pie, zig to the zag! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="??" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> They work together absolutely seamlessly.</p>
<p><strong>Mophie external battery charger</strong> &#8211; There is nothing worse than a dead iPhone. I¡¯ve not only revived my own iPhone but my friends¡¯ phones.</p>
<h3><img class="size-full wp-image-1274 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Soumyakanti-Ray.jpg" alt="Soumyakanti Ray" width="250" height="250" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Soumyakanti-Ray.jpg 250w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Soumyakanti-Ray-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" />Soumyakanti Ray &#8211; <a href="http://www.rayarena.com/" name="soumyakanti">Rayarena</a></h3>
<p>iPhone is undoubtedly an excellent device, but it has some restrictions on use. This is why, most people don&#8217;t mind preferring a low-end Android phone, for the convenience it offers. One of the biggest problems that iPhone users go through is the low storage issue.</p>
<p>Until you have the 128GB variant, you will require a big chunk storage to keep your data that include songs, videos, and photos. However, at such circumstances, one simple, small and portable Flash Drive can be your best recourse.</p>
<p>If you are in need of Flash Drive, we would greatly recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CIEBU22/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Sandisk SanDisk USB 3.0 Flash Drive</a> without thinking twice. This flash drive takes care of all your videos and photos, and you can use it &#8211; anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>Music is a dope for some, and the ultimate savior for some. Almost everyone has a strong feeling for good music and loves to listen to wonderful melodies. However, most of the times, he/she feels that the conventional long wires for music are way too messy.</p>
<p>Therefore, wireless music is the best way to enjoy music hassle-free. Trust <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013HSW4SM/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Jaybird X2</a> headphones for an incredible wireless experience.</p>
<p>The charging cable, with most of the Apple devices, is a sore aspect. Most of the times, they get easily damaged and aren&#8217;t long enough to reach your bed. Here are <a href="http://www.nativeunion.com/products/cables/?17">some cables</a> made by the Native Union, which are highly durable and long enough to stay in reach.</p>

<p>There are seemingly endless choices for iPhone accessories out there, and I¡¯ve got to tell you, I go through iPhone accessories like candy. One day I like something I¡¯m using, and another day I find it to be a nuisance, and I end up leaving it at home and buying something completely different to suit my needs.</p>
<p>Regardless, there are still some accessories that I still use on a day-to-day basis, and in this piece, I¡¯ll show you my top 5 favorite iPhone accessories that I use on a daily basis and why.</p>
<p>Before getting started, one thing I¡¯d like to note before I start is that these are my five favorite iPhone accessories that I use on a daily basis. I¡¯m not trying to push them on anyone because I know everyone¡¯s opinion is going to vary and not everyone is going to agree with my choices.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I do hope that in posting this it¡¯ll help some people with accessory discovery. My daily driver is an iPhone 6 Plus, which is the previous-generation 5.5-inch iPhone.</p>
<p>Some of these accessories are also compatible with other iPhones out of the box, but some of them are available in different versions that are made specifically for all the different shapes and sizes of iPhones on the market today.</p>
<p>Having said that, let¡¯s get into it, shall we?</p>
<div class="su-tabs su-tabs-style-default my-custom-tabs" data-active="1"><div class="su-tabs-nav"><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Otterbox Alpha Glass Privacy</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Speck Candyshell Grip</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Plantronics M70 Bluetooth Headset</span></div><div class="su-tabs-panes"><div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>Probably one of my favorite and most-used accessories is the Alpha Glass Privacy screen protector from OtterBox.</p>
<p>It¡¯s a tempered glass screen protector, which means it looks and feels like the factory glass screen on the iPhone. It doesn&#8217;t reduce the screen¡¯s sensitivity capacities and also comes with the added benefit of blocking out the display at stark viewing angles. This way peering eyes around you can¡¯t see what you¡¯re doing on your iPhone ¨C only you can.</p>
<p>The screen protector is also still a fully-functional, multi-layer screen protector that helps in keeping your main glass display from scratching and shattering.</p>
<p>It hugs the Home button and front-facing camera/speaker/sensors very well without being too tight and just feels like an overall good and natural fit.</p>
<p>One of the things I like about it is that it seems to work with almost every case I¡¯ve ever tried with my iPhone, apart from the ones that come with built-in screen protectors.</p>
<p>This gives you the flexibility of changing cases every so often, and still keeping the benefits of the privacy glass whenever you want to.</p>
<p>A word of warning ¨C although OtterBox doesn¡¯t list this screen protector as compatible with the iPhone 6s Plus, I want to confirm with everyone, just as I have with OtterBox, that it will work just fine with the iPhone 6s Plus.</p>
<p>The reason it¡¯s not listed as compatible is because it may interfere with the front-facing flash Apple coded into iOS 9, but 3D Touch and everything else works as expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>I¡¯ve tried a lot of cases for my iPhone ¨C believe me ¨C and one of the best I¡¯ve found so far in terms of not only protection but also how the case feels in my hand and how responsive the buttons are is the Speck Candyshell Grip.</p>
<p>I work on cars a lot, and this means getting dirty and using my iPhone¡¯s rear-facing LED flash a lot to see things in dark places. I¡¯ve tried lots of protective cases, and this one is just right regarding protection and size.</p>
<p>It¡¯s not too thick, but it has a strong protective feel to it. I¡¯ve dropped my iPhone in my engine compartment plenty of times, and you¡¯d never know because the case has kept my iPhone protected each and every time.</p>
<p>The volume and power buttons have a very crisp ¡®click¡¯ through the protective rubber button boots on the sides of the case, which I can¡¯t say for all cases that I¡¯ve tried.</p>
<p>The responsiveness of the buttons feels almost like there¡¯s no case on my iPhone at all, and the click you feel is still very much audible through the case.</p>
<p>One of the useful features of this case is the rubber grips that go all across the back of the case.</p>
<p>When you¡¯re using your iPhone one-handed and always feel like you¡¯re going to drop it while texting someone, especially the case with today¡¯s larger iPhones, those grips help you keep the iPhone in your hand without worrying about having butter fingers.</p>
<p>The cut-outs for the ports are also big enough to fit all my third-party headphones, speakers, Lightning connectors, and other goodies, so I have no complaints in that department either. Engineering did a great job making this case and I¡¯d recommend it to (almost) anyone.</p>

<div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix">
<p>I do so much driving that it¡¯s just not physically possible for me to constantly hold my iPhone up to my ear all day long. The Plantronics M70 Bluetooth headset has been my daily answer to that problem and it is a wonderful and affordable Bluetooth headset that works great with the iPhone.</p>
<p>The Plantronics M70 Bluetooth headset has been my daily solution to that problem, and it is a fantastic and affordable Bluetooth headset that works great with the iPhone.</p>
<p>Once being paired with the iPhone, the device¡¯s battery level shows in the iPhone¡¯s Status Bar, as well as in Notification Center under the Battery widget. The headset also supports invoking Siri by holding down on the button on the side for a couple of seconds, which I find super helpful throughout the day considering my iPhone¡¯s internal microphones are dead because of water damage.</p>

<p>This headset is easy to hear even in noisy environments, and the easy volume adjustments mean you can adjust for both noisy and quiet environments with ease. It also works great for listening to music; it¡¯s not just for answering calls. If I feel like jamming to some music while I drive, or while I walk, it¡¯s an excellent tool to have</p>
<p>If I feel like jamming to some music while I drive, or while I walk, it¡¯s a nice tool to have in that respect as well.</p>
<p>Regarding battery life, I can get an easy 11 hours of usage out of this headset before it has to be charged again, and it takes under 2 hours to fully charge it, which to me is like no time at all. It¡¯s charged with a Micro-USB type of cable that plugs into a USB port on your computer or an AC adapter for your outlet in your wall.</p>
<p>In terms of comfort, I think this is one of the more comfortable options out there, but just like anything else you wear on your ears, you may want to take it off after a while. Nonetheless, it¡¯s so lightweight you sometimes forget it¡¯s even there.</p>

<p>When it comes to iPhone accessories, I always recommend these three products which I am personally using myself.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019ZVL418/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Jorno Ultra-Thin Folding Mobile Keyboard</a> &#8211; It is a lightweight keyboard specially designed for the iPhones which could also be used for the laptops and other devices. For just a few bucks, this handy, compact, good looking keyboard is an excellent choice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DF1N54S/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">HooToo Flash Drive</a> &#8211; Most of the iPhone users run out of storage. This device which comes with a Lightning connector at one end and USB 3.0 on the other is something more than just a storage device. It can simultaneously connect to iPhone and your laptop making it possible to manage your files better. I am personally using it, and yes, it is good.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0176HQ1O8/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Aukey 20,000 mAh Portable Charger</a> &#8211; Only few power banks come with the Lightning connector, and this is one of them. This extremely powerful battery pack can surely recharge your iPhone several times. The charging time is also way better than other devices we tested. It is also coming with Two full USB ports which allow charging extra devices if necessary.</p>
<p>So, these are our top 3 picks as the best iPhone accessories you should give a try.</p>
<h3><strong><img class="size-full wp-image-1200 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Daven-Lu.jpg" alt="Daven Lu" width="250" height="250" srcset="http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Daven-Lu.jpg 250w, http://1c8qo82qhp8l334k5o17fkce.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Daven-Lu-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></strong>Daven Lu &#8211; <a href="http://www.audiodevotion.com/" name="daven">AudioDevotion</a></h3>
<p><strong>Audio Technica DSR7BT</strong> &#8211; A wireless Bluetooth headphone with a new technology known as the Pure Digital Drive system. Typically, headphones can only receive an analog signal to be outputted through the headphone drivers. What makes the DSR7BT different is that it is entirely digital.</p>
<p>With the AudioTechnica Pure Digital Drive system, audio can be played through the headphones without ever needing to be put into analog signals before output. In short, this means there is zero signal loss, and thus zero musical quality loss between your mp3 player and the headphones.</p>
<p><b>Znaps Magnetic Lightning Cable</b> &#8211; This lightning cable is completely waterproof and turns your iPhone lightning port into a MagSafe one typically used in Macbooks. This means that your phone won&#8217;t be yanked into the ground if you accidently step on a cable or bump into someone while holding your phone wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Moshi iVisor Screen Protector</strong> &#8211; This is different from most screen protectors it&#8217;s an entire solid screen protector instead of just a film. The company guarantees that it will be bubble free. It can resist everything from hammers to knives.</p>

<p>Here are my top iPhone accessories:</p>
<p>1. Moment Wide Lens.</p>
<p>These lenses take superb pictures and are perfect for landscape shots. The build quality is by far the best I&#8217;ve seen, they look great and is the only lens I&#8217;m happy to use when I don&#8217;t have my DSLR on me. I also love the way it mounts onto the iPhone, by attaching the mounting plate and then rotating the lens on feels so much more like a DSLR than any other clip-on lens.</p>
<p>2. TuneBand Sports Armband.</p>
<p>Perfect when I&#8217;m running or during a gym session. They&#8217;re comfortable. There¡¯s no moving or flapping about; the iPhone just stays there. I know I can focus on my workout without having to worry about my iPhone bothering me or falling off.</p>
<p>3. The Anker Ultra Slim extended battery case.</p>
<p>If I¡¯m traveling lightly, I don¡¯t want extra bulk charging packs and cables, so the Anker battery case is ideal. It¡¯s also great when my battery is running low, and I&#8217;m on the move, I just grab the case and know my iPhone will last another two days.</p>

<p><strong>Anker Battery Case</strong> &#8211; My favorite iPhone accessories are the ones that are seamless. Accessories where I have to carry a separate gadget become a hassle. The Anker Battery Case is a phone case that doubles as a charger. It protects your phone while adding that extra battery life you need.</p>
<p>A dead battery situation almost takes you 200 years back because we do everything on our phones, including that important Uber ride at 1 AM in the morning and communicating through Whatsapp or Facebook Messenger to your friends.</p>
<p>The Anker Case packs a 2850 mAh battery that they promise gives you an extra 60 hours of Audio, 13 hours of Video and 12 Hours of Browsing. You also get an audio jack extender with this case.</p>
<p>It¡¯s a must have for people who are worried about losing battery at any point in time.</p>
<p><strong>Top Case for the iPhone</strong> &#8211; One of the situations that I fear is when I have to work when I¡¯m traveling. I can check emails and look at updates, but my actual work involves writing content and replying to emails I don¡¯t want to carry an iPad and for me, the best situation is getting a case like the TOP case, which has a QWERTY keyboard that comes part of the case. I can use With this case you can work continuously for 30 hours. If you are on holiday and exploring and don¡¯t want to carry an iPad or a laptop with you, carry the TOP case.</p>
<p><strong>Mountie</strong> &#8211; It is an excellent gadget that lets you hook your iPhone to your laptop with a simple gadget. You can use the Mountie to keep your iPhone right next to the monitor.</p>
<p>This is useful for checking notifications on your phone and copying some important information. Developers can also use it as a multi-screen by having a laptop and a tablet right next to each other. The only downside to Mountie is that it does not work with desktops!</p>

<p><strong>Protecting Case</strong> &#8211; My number 1 iPhone accessory will always be a good case. I&#8217;m currently using a LifeProof on my 6S. A few things I love about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The way it keeps the iPhone from getting scratched and cracked.</li>
<li>Part of this is in the presence of casing itself.</li>
<li>LifeProof changes the weight and feel of the phone in a way that is somehow, magically, able to decrease the likelihood that I drop it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Waterproofing &#8211; I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;ve never tried submersion but I love that I can use my phone in the shower for listening to music, texting, and checking my email. I also appreciate that it&#8217;s protected when I drop it in puddles&#8230; I will say, though, that the LifeProof is far from my perfect case. The screen over the camera decreases the photo quality such that I may as well be using my first flip phone. It also makes it very difficult for people to hear me on phone calls, and vice versa.</p>
<p>This alone pretty much negates about half the usefulness of the case, as I&#8217;m constantly peeling it off to either take a photo or make a call. (Maybe someone else will recommend a better case for your article!)</p>
<p>Regardless, with how expensive iPhones are, my top pick for an accessory is something to protect my investment.</p>

<p><strong>Wireless Charger Kit</strong> &#8211; This is a very portable accessory which I use in my day to day life. It charges really quick and saves my time really well in urgency. Plus it is really safe and durable to use as well as there is no fear of overcharging or phone sliding.</p>
<p>i<strong>Phone Lens</strong> &#8211; Being a travel maniac, I love to have an iPhone lens kit with me wherever I go as it turns my phone into a DSLR camera. The lens can easily attach to my iPhone as the clasp opens around 120¡±. Plus it comes with a case for safety purposes.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone Flash Drive</strong> &#8211; I use a USB flash drive for fast storage or file transfer which provides speed up to 26MB/s reading speed, 10MB/s writing speed. Be it photos or videos, the flash drive makes it super easy for me to transfer them all from my iPhone. The portability and performance are superb.</p>
<p>For me, my favorite would be the iPhone Lens as it is much more than an accessory, it gives me the freedom to explore the world with just my phone in the best way possible.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0117RFOEG/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Bose SoundSport In-Ear Earphones</a></strong> &#8211; These headphones are essential to my day. From listening to music at my desk to after work runs. If you&#8217;re in need of earphones that actually sit in your ear while you run. I can&#8217;t recommend these enough for quality and comfort.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014ZVV56M/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">EasyAcc 2nd Gen 15000mAh Power Bank</a></strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m a frequent traveler and there&#8217;s nothing worse than losing access to your maps app if you&#8217;re in a foreign place.

<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I17W2YK/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">HooToo iPhone Lightning Flash Drive USB 3.0 Adapter</a></strong> &#8211; I have tried several types of flash drives for my iOS devices and eventually, I think this one is the best. The transfer speed is amazing as it¡¯s faster than all my previous drives.</p>
<p>It can read up to 80 MB/s and write up to 40MB/s. The size and weight are perfectly portable so I can easily carry it with me whether I¡¯m working or traveling.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGQM2LL/A/iphone-6-6s-smart-battery-case-white">Apple Smart Battery Case</a></strong> &#8211; This case is more expensive than competing models but I think it¡¯s totally worth it. Unlike most other iPhone battery cases, it is built much tougher, not easy to be broken and works with Lightning cables.</p>
<p>The one-piece design feels really comfortable and is sleek. With the case fully charged and my iPhone inside, I¡¯m still at 100% by late afternoon. By 11 p.m, the case¡¯s battery was expended but the iPhone still have about 65% percent charge left.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.kenu.com/products/stance">Kenu Stance Tripod</a></strong> &#8211; This tripod is one of my favorite gadgets.

<p>The best accessories iPhone can support are falsely assumed to be expensive. The truth is that the best accessories rarely require you to whip out more than $50.</p>
<p>The first accessory I recommend is Belkin Lightning Audio and Charger RockStar. I haven¡¯t understood why they did away with the audio jack on the iPhone 7. It¡¯s only a matter of time before we misplace our wireless headphones, so the cable is really an investment; because it lets you charge your phone as well as listen to music at the same time through the same port. It costs a mere 40 bucks too!</p>
<p>Then, there¡¯s the iHome Mini Speaker Cube which comes for all of 17 dollars and still delivers quite a performance. In fact, it can be used for any device with a 3.5mm jack, and also supports FM Radio</p>
<p>But the biggest issue with phones today is that we can¡¯t get enough of them. So a longer cord is pretty essential as well. I find EnacFire Lighting cable pack of 3 ft, six ft and ten ft especially useful. It¡¯s great because you can choose to keep a special cord for your desk in the office and save the longer one for the bedroom to snuggle and binge watch movies on a Sunday.</p>

<p>I¡¯ve been a proud iPhone user for more than a year now. During the little experience that I have had while using iPhone, there were quite a few accessories that made my life easier.</p>
<p>I would like to place the <strong>iPhone charging dock station</strong> first on the list. I love the sight of my iPhone standing straight while getting charged, without hanging on to any wires. It complements my room as well.</p>
<p>Next up, is the <strong>iPhone car holder</strong>. It¡¯s a tad bit difficult task to pick up a call, play music or even access the iPhone while driving unless you have a flexible iPhone car holder.</p>
<p>Along with it, Siri helps a lot to take things hands-free and make the driving hassle free.</p>
<p>The last one is a sleek and simple <strong>iPhone case</strong>. I get paranoid if I find a visible dirt on my iPhone. Now, I stay miles away from all the graphical iPhone cases.</p>
<p>I prefer a soft, durable and transparent iPhone case. It holds the slim look of my iPhone and provides the required protection at the same time.</p>
<p>My personal favorite among them is the iPhone car holder. I really enjoy my time in the car and it&#8217;s all because of the convenience being provided by the iPhone car holder.</p>

<p>iPhone¡¯s are extremely popular these days, despite the stiff competition from other phone manufacturers apple is still going strong and alone in 2016 they sold 1 billion units, yeah I know that&#8217;s crazy.</p>
<p>Even after Steve Job¡¯s passing people camp 24 hours outside apple stores whenever there is a new iPhone launch just so they can get their hands on the latest models proves just how devoted this fan base really is.</p>
<p>With the growing popularity of these phones, it&#8217;s no wonder that many the accessories market has exploded with an endless choice, from cases of any color of the rainbow, to selfie sticks, Case wallets and you name it.</p>
<p>I know it can be confusing to decide what accessories you really need for your iPhone, so iv compiled a mini list of the top 3 accessories I think to cover a whole range of activities, so without further hesitation let&#8217;s jump straight to them.</p>
<p><strong>Mad Catz Micro C.T.R.L.i Mobile Gamepad</strong> &#8211; This little gadget turns your iPhone into a portable gaming console, think Nintendo DS but way more fun and useful. It connects seamlessly with your phone via Bluetooth and has an adjustable clip, so your iPhone can fit snug into it. It comes with an official apple certification, which means you will have no problems make good use of it. With the AAA batteries you can expect around 35 40 hours game time from the controller alone, this is good for people that tend to travel or commute a lot the ideal scenario would be on the bus, train or plane.</p>
<p><strong>XENVO Premium Camera Lens Kit</strong> &#8211; Smartphone photography, who doesn&#8217;t do it, these days you don&#8217;t need an expensive and heavy DSLR camera to take great pictures, you just need a relatively new smartphone and perhaps if you want to turn things up a notch you can even use the Xenvo lens kit on your iPhone for better results.</p>
<p>Basically it¡¯s a mini wide angle that attaches to your iPhone&#8217;s front or back facing camera and it gives you 45% more picture without losing out on any quality, also if you like to take close of pictures of food or flowers then you can do that too with the Macro lens feature, so now you can start shooting fancy pictures for you Instagram account.</p>
<p><strong>Multifunctional iPhone Case</strong> &#8211; Or like how I like to call this case (Party Survival Case) this protective housing for your iPhone has definitely covered you at any party you go, let¡¯s agree that smartphones have already a ton of functionality as is, like planners, music players, communication, games and so on, with this case it adds a layer of physical capabilities like beer opener, cigarette lighter and you can also attach it on your bicycle&#8217;s steering handles, so you would agree if I say that Chuck Norris would be proud of this case.</p>

<p>Apple is a universal brand and people love it. You can make your Apple iPhone even more interesting if you use different accessories, because a mobile is not everything in itself, for instance, you need a cable or charger to charge the mobile. In a similar manner, there are other accessories of Apple which you will find much more interesting and here are three that I think are the best</p>
<p><strong>Travel USB Cables:</strong> ordinary iPhone cables work perfectly well, but when it comes to the matter of traveling, space matters and for this reason, you must switch to shorter and highly-reliable travel cables that you can easily put in your pocket.</p>
<p><strong>External Battery:</strong> the first thing that many people consider when buying any mobile is the battery timing. Apple users always find it exhausting and frustrating to charge their mobile again and again. It is really a trouble when you are traveling and your mobile battery is dead. You can buy an external battery that will charge the mobile: it¡¯s a great accessory.</p>
<p><strong>Laptop Backpack:</strong> If you have a Mac or an iPad then you certainly need a proper backpack to carry the Mac, iPad and their accessories. It is really difficult to carry these things without a proper bag, therefore you should buy one.</p>

<p><strong>Kenu Stance Tripod</strong> &#8211; According to me, it is one of the best accessories for iPhone, Kenu Stance Tripod, especially available for iPhone, it will be best for those who wanna be some out of their device, and want to watch videos, without holding their iPhone in their hands.</p>
<p><strong>TuneBand Sports Armband</strong> &#8211; TuneBand Sports Armband, is a perfect case for those who are addicted to sports activities and own an iPhone, if you are a sportsman, and running is in your daily schedule, then it is best for you, it is perfect case and cover for your iPhone, with this you have no need to hold your device, it will tie your iPhone to your arm tightly and, your device will be safely staying with you.</p>
<p><strong>Belkin Lightning Audio + Charge Rockstar</strong> &#8211; If you have an iPhone 7, and missing 3.5 mm jack, then this is the simple Lightning port splitter, that can turn your single port into two, it means with this you can listen to music with ear plugs and charge your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus at the same time.</p>

<p>The first thing came to my mind is the <strong>Apple&#8217;s Lightning dock</strong>, it makes those 3.5 MM jack headphones useful again. Since there are people out there (including me) who wants to use their favorite wired headphones and charge the phone, both at the same time.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty ointment to me and not costs that much. And I&#8217;m really not obsessed with the AirPods. Wait, should I be?</p>
<p><strong>Gekkopod</strong> is so cool as it&#8217;s a five-legged animal, oh, It looks like it but it&#8217;s a mobile tripod. Using its arms that just needs to wrap around a solid object makes it possible to mount an iPhone anywhere. You can also tilt the phone 360 degrees using its Ballhead accessory.</p>
<p>I¡¯m a blogger and I spent more than 12 hours staring the computer screen, but things could slightly change with the <strong>Stand-alone keyboard</strong>, it makes typing a detailed email more accurate than typing on the touch glass.</p>

<p><strong>Tile</strong> &#8211; If you¡¯re someone who frequently misplaces your keys, wallet or other belongings, then Tile is a must for you. Tile is a Bluetooth tracker and iPhone application that helps you retrieve lost items.</p>
<p>This handy gadget can also help you locate your phone, all you have to do is press the Tile button and wait for your mobile to start ringing. As long as you¡¯re in range, you never need to worry about losing your smartphone again!</p>
<p><strong>Portable Charger</strong> &#8211; A study that we did at finder.com.au last year found that Aussies will go to the most desperate measures to charge their phone (see <a href="https://www.finder.com.au/the-most-desperate-things-australians-do-to-charge-their-phones">full analysis here</a>). These ranged from using a powerpoint in an office building they had no business visiting to even hanging in a public toilet. A portable charger is one of the most valuable iPhone accessories you can invest in Cygnett and Plox have some pretty good ones at affordable prices.</p>
<p><strong>Speakers</strong> &#8211; Wireless speakers have blown up in popularity over the last few years. They are the quickest and easiest way to listen to your music wherever you go. Their portability means they¡¯re great for parties or barbecues at the local park.</p>

<p>The first on my list is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EVN8ZAS/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Ztylus Revolver</a> and Z-prime. They are a kind external lens for your iPhone 6s and 6s plus. The revolver has 4 lens attachments(fish-eye, wide angle, macro and a CPL filter) inside it and is very easy to use.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AYF1X2E/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Z-prime</a> is also a great product. It can give very high quality super wide-angle with the 2x telephoto with very little distortion.</p>
<p>The second on my list is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C6O78SO/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">ThinCharge battery</a> case for iPhone. This is the thinnest battery case yet and you won&#8217;t have to wait every day to get your phone charged. Just charge the case overnight and it can easily get through a day!</p>
<p>The third one on my list is <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/asap-connect-the-future-of-usb-cables-apple-iphone#/">ASAP connect</a> for iPhones and Android smartphones too! You must have heard about MagSafe connectors for MacBook, right? This is very similar to that. It is kind of magnetic connector which also works as a reversible cable. It&#8217;s very helpful in a time of hurry and there is no chance of getting the tip damaged.</p>

<p>Being an avid iPhone guy for years now, I have come to realize you don&#8217;t need a lot of accessories to make the most out of your iPhone. In fact, the more accessories you have the less productive the phone becomes. I look for accessories that highlight the phone and not take away from it.</p>
<p><strong>A dash holder. I</strong> like sleek phones so cases bother me. So a simple magnet on the back does the trick.</p>
<p><strong>Wireless headphones</strong> with a good mic. I do business often on the road. Quality headphones play a large role in that.</p>
<p><strong>AppleTV</strong> is more than an accessory but it&#8217;s a perfect tool to take your iPhone to the next level. We utilize it for company meetings and more.<br />

<p><strong>1. Heavy Case.</strong> Silk¡¯s Base Grip is the best all-around iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus case for most people. We know from years of feedback from readers, staff, and even family and friends that most people want a case that¡¯s slim, plainly designed, reliably protective, and inexpensive. That¡¯s exactly what you get with the Base Grip.</p>
<p><strong>2. Tagrus Cable</strong>. It has one of the finest material, it works as good as the original. Technically, it gives 2A output as this much required which is quite efficient for your iPhone.</p>
<p><strong>3. Powerbank Mi 20000mAh.</strong> It has the fast charging 2A support with 1.5A support. If you want a good power bank then this is the best choice for your iPhone.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m more interested in the accessories which are of great use in day-to-day usage:</p>
<p><strong>SanDisk Connect Wireless Stick 64 GB Pen Drive </strong>&#8211; If you are someone who travels a lot and likes to watch movies or videos on your iPhone then this one is must for you. This wireless Stick doesn&#8217;t cost that much and allows you to access data on your iPhone or even on your Android on-the-air anywhere without even requiring an Internet connection.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth Speaker</strong> &#8211; For a music lover surviving without Headphones or a Bluetooth speaker is difficult. If you are not willing to spend much on Bluetooth Speakers then you can go with budget oriented Bluetooth Speakers like JBL Flip 3, JBL Charge 2(Recommended), Sony XRS XB3 which costs less than $150. I&#8217;ve been using JBL Charge 2 for 5 months and it&#8217;s definitely worth the price.</p>
<p><strong>Power Bank</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s always good to have some power backup in case your iPhone&#8217;s battery runs out. Invest in power banks which are easily available and not very expensive.</p>
<p>Personally, I would recommend Xiaomi Mi 20000 mAh Power Bank. For iPhone 7 users, make sure you have a good quality USB Type-C cable for your power bank.</p>

<p><strong>Spigen Liquid Crystal Case</strong> &#8211; You may ask what is special in this case which makes it different from the rest? Well this case, first of all, looks pretty elegant thanks to the clear design. Apart from this, the case feels premium and robust in hands.</p>
<p>There will be times when the iPhone will slip from your hands, and this protective case will save you from burning a big hole in your pocket. So if you are buying iPhone then definitely make sure to buy this along else you may regret your decision later.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Smart Battery Case </strong>&#8211; Let get this straight. Apple has to improve the iPhone&#8217;s Battery life because iPhones are inferior in battery backup and it will be very hard to get to the end of the day with just one charge.</p>
<p>So if you are the one who doesn&#8217;t like to sit near the power outlet and use your iPhone while it&#8217;s connected to the charger, then this is for you.</p>
<p>It surely is priced a bit on higher side, but that&#8217;s what makes Apple different from rest of the mobile phone manufacturers.</p>
<p><strong>Desk Charger and Sync Dock Stand</strong> &#8211; This Desk Charger is also a good choice to buy as if you are working in a corporate it will save you from the hectic of connecting your iPhone again and again to your desk computer. It is directly attached to the computer via USB port, and you can just connect your iPhone to the dock stand. Apart from all this it also charges your smartphone side by side.</p>

<p><strong>Car Mounts </strong>&#8211; Smart and safe driving is important for all cell phone users. There are several great mounts on the market that easily clip onto the air conditioning vents of the car and enable a smooth and quick connection process. These mounts also limit texting and driving because it is more difficult to send off that &#8220;quick&#8221; text when the phone is mounted to your dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>Wallet Cases</strong> &#8211; We love a good wallet case. There are several cheap protective cases that have spaces for credit cards and a few dollars in cash. These cases not only free up space in a purse or bag, they also help keep everything in one place to reduce the risk of losing money or credit cards. We have found that most iPhone users look after the phone with much more diligence than their wallet and if both are in the same place, it is more difficult to lose them!</p>
<p><strong>Portable Chargers</strong> &#8211; Especially for business owners and people on the go for most of the day, having a portable charger is a must-have accessory. For many people, their phones are the key source of their business and a period of no battery could result in the loss of income. There are several small portable chargers out there that are easy to store and do not take up too much space.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the top three basic iPhone accessories that every power user should have are <strong>the headphones</strong>, as they sit comfortably in my ears. I use them on a daily basis, whether I go to the gym or simply sit at my desk. From a technical viewpoint, their quality is one of the best on the market.</p>
<p>Another accessory is the<strong> lightning charging cable.</strong> It has a slick and simple design, yet their use ubiquitous.</p>
<p>And last, but not least, in our modern society, you cannot go without a <strong>powerful external battery</strong>. I strongly consider that this accessory requires no explanation what so ever for the people that are connected day in and day out.</p>

<p>Here are my 3 recommended accessories for your iPhone.</p>
<p><strong>HooToo Flash Drive</strong> &#8211; For extra storage space &amp; USB. It&#8217;s an MFi-certified small flash drive with storage space up to 64 GB with a connector at one end &amp; USB 3.0 at other. Which can be used as a storage device and also for transfer.</p>
<p><strong>Mad Catz Micro C.T.R.L.i Mobile Gamepad</strong> &#8211; GamePad for Gamers</p>
<p>This is a gamepad for the hardcore gamer who loves joystick style of playing. It works with IOS 7 &amp; above and works with Bluetooth connection. It comes with AAA batteries and has 40 hours of GamePlay.</p>
<p>A <strong>selfie stick</strong> is a must have accessory for selfie lovers. When it comes to camera nothing can beat iPhone. Adding a Bluetooth selfie stick which can extend to 31 inches with 270-degree rotation will be an enhancement to it.</p>
<p>Thought the selfie stick can be replaced by a JBL Bluetooth speaker or a Beat&#8217;s on the ear headset, but again it depends on individual passion on it.</p>

<p><strong>Lifeproof Cases</strong> &#8211; These cases are great and very very popular amongst our users, simply for the fact that they are waterproofing the phone, and also impact resistant to prevent accidental drops.</p>
<p><strong>Mophie Juice Packs</strong> &#8211; With longer consumption of the iPhone, there&#8217;s never enough power for it to last throughout an entire day. The Mophie cases are perfect companion cases for power users.</p>
<p><strong>Story Leather Holsters</strong> &#8211; This is a shameless plug of my company&#8217;s own product. This is more than a product, as it&#8217;s a custom made to order service that custom tailors a case to fit the iPhone.</p>
<p>Nowadays, everyone put their iPhones in a case, but all cases come in different sizes (or shapes), and as cases get bigger, they become hard to slide into a pocket.</p>
<p>This is where our leather holsters come into place, we custom tailor a case to fit regardless of how big/small your phone is, and best of all, you can get to choose from over 100 different genuine leather colors/textures, and create that one of a kind luxury piece to house your iPhone.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://bellroy.com/products/phone-wallet/i7/tamarillo">Belkin Phone Wallet</a></strong> &#8211; This is a great combination high-quality case with room for cards and cash together with your phone and gives excellent protection. My iPhone has survived more than one fall inside this case, the last time face down from 3 feet onto a stone floor. My iPhone escaped unscathed without a scratch. I&#8217;ve used my case daily for over a year and it still looks like new.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GFA1ZCU/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Syncwire Charging Cable</a></strong> &#8211; The one advantage that this cable has over the regular plastic charging cables is that it&#8217;s made from braided nylon so it won&#8217;t fray.</p>
<p>Anker PowerCore+ mini charger <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005QI1A8C/?tag=10beasts-20" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a><br />

<p>If you travel frequently you&#8217;ll know that there are times when your iPhone runs low on power and there isn&#8217;t a convenient charging point available. Or perhaps you need to charge both your iPhone and your laptop at the same time and you only have one power adaptor for the country that you&#8217;re in.</p>
<p>This small, lightweight charging unit will charge your phone quickly and you can use it to fully charge your iPhone twice or even three times before you need to recharge the battery itself.</p>
<p>Mine lives in my laptop bag and is always there as power &#8220;insurance&#8221; if my iPhone runs low. Being portable I can just keep the phone attached to the charger in my bag or jacket pocket if I need to charge whilst I&#8217;m on the move.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t use mine often but it&#8217;s great knowing that I have it if I need it. On my last long haul flight to Australia, I used it to charge my iPhone on the plane as I was charging my laptop from the USB connection at my seat.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve personally used the PowerCore+ mini with my iPhone 6 Plus for over a year now. I think that the PowerCore 5000 would probably be a better choice for iPhone 6S and 7.</p>
<div class="yb">If you travel regularly invest in a separate charger, cable and a power adaptor for multiple countries for your iPhone and then leave them in your regular travel bag. The cost is pretty minimal, you&#8217;ll never need to worry about forgetting to pack chargers, cables or adaptors again and you know that you&#8217;ll always have power whenever and wherever you need it.</div>

It is very easy to insert and remove the iPhone from this armband.</p>

<p><strong>Card Case</strong> &#8211; This is necessary and important because it&#8217;s easy to drop your phone and scratch it. But more importantly is that the case stores a few credit cards. This makes it easier to pay when eating out or grabbing a cup of coffee without having to pull out your wallet. The best part is that these cases are very slim and the designs are minimal and don&#8217;t add a lot of bulk to your phone.</p>
<p><strong>Headphones</strong> &#8211; Every person has a headphone preference, but these are better than the earbuds because they block out the noise and the sound quality is better. The best part is that headphones have become a fashion accessory and there&#8217;s no need to put them in your bag, wearing them or just having it wrapped around you has become widely popular.</p>
<p><strong>Camera lens attachment</strong> &#8211; The cameras on the phone are great. However, there are times a camera lens attachment comes in handy for different angles and views that the camera itself doesn&#8217;t capture. The best part is that these lenses are small and minimalist and stick on securely.</p>

<p><strong>HooToo Flash Drive:</strong><br />
It is really common that people don&#8217;t go for high storage capacity when buying iPhone as Apple do charges for their storage space. If you are one of those who has purchased iPhone with 16GB memory space then you are well aware that it is not sufficient for you. HooToo Flash Drive is a flash drive with 3.0 port with 64gb storage. It`s is very handy.</p>
<p><strong>Anker A7908 Bluetooth Speaker:</strong><br />
We al love the sound which is not just audible or loud but also known as quality sound. When it comes boosting the sound I recommend Anker A7908 Bluetooth speaker. It is a 2-inch speaker which is very handy with 20 hours playback capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Monoprice Battery Backup:</strong><br />
Battery drain is the big issue in all smartphones including iPhone also. It is always advisable to carry an extra battery or a power backup for your smartphone. I recommend using Monoprice battery backup. It is a 2600mAH with LED light. It also shows that how much battery left in power backup.</p>

<p>My favorite iPhone accessories are:</p>
<p><strong>1. Belkin Lightning Audio + Charge Rockstar</strong></p>
<p>I recommend this to iPhone users because you can use your device for charging and can listen music at the same time. Simply, it&#8217;s a lightning port splitter.</p>
<p><strong>2. HooToo Flash Drive</strong></p>
<p>Storage for 16GB or 32GB variants is a big issue. This handy, compact flash drive can potentially help out. It has a Lightning connector at one end and a USB 3.0 port at the other. In the middle, there¡¯s 64GB of storage for you to fill with photos, movies, or other files. It¡¯s easy to slip into a pocket or bag, it transfers files quickly via a handy app, and it offers an alternative backup method that doesn¡¯t require a cable. It is also MFi-certified.</p>
<p><strong>3. Mujjo Touchscreen Gloves</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easy to use your phone in winters, you can&#8217;t use your device with gloves but they allow you to touch your phone with warm gloves.. For colder climes, we recommend the double-layered gloves, available in three sizes with a magnetic clasp for a snug fit. They¡¯re really comfortable, warm, and stylish at the same time. Mujjo does also offer basic varieties for a bit less, or you can splash out on a leather pair.</p>
