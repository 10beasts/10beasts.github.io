I think protective cases are the best iPhone accessories because they save you hundreds of dollars almost every time you drop your device.</p><p>I always choose a slim fit case. It&#8217;s very cheap, looks good on the iPhone design and most important protect your device from drops.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth Headphones</strong> &#8211; The second accessory you should have with your iPhone are a pair of Bluetooth headphones.</p><p>If you are a tech geek, then you should know that Bluetooth headphones are the future. Wired headphones are quickly going out of the market, especially with the Apple&#8217;s new iPhone 7 device.</p><p>I use Wireless Beats by Dre headphones, and I love them. They sound good, are very stylish and quick to setup.</p><p><strong>Portable Charger</strong> &#8211; I use my iPhone a lot, and by a lot, I mean about 6 hours screen time. With such heavy usage, the battery runs out very quickly. That&#8217;s why I always hold a portable battery charger on my backpack. It is a must-have accessory, and they are very cheap.</p><p>You don&#8217;t have to go for a 10,000 mAh external battery, but a 3,000 mAh capacity external charger can charge your iPhone battery twice so that It would be enough for an average user.</p><h3><img class="size-full wp-image-1183 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Josiah-Nelson.jpg" alt="Josiah Nelson" width="250" height="250" srcset="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Josiah-Nelson.jpg 250w, http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Josiah-Nelson-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"/>Josiah Nelson &#8211; <a href="https://www.primevox.net/" name="josi">Primevox</a></h3><p>First I would say it&#8217;s going to depend on what you use your phone for most. However, 3 of the best general accessories I can think of that would apply to most people are a tempered glass screen protector, an external flash drive with lightning and a battery pack.</p><p><strong>Tempered glass screen protector</strong> &#8211; It is probably my favorite thing ever. It&#8217;s like a bulletproof vest for your screen. I can&#8217;t say how many times those have saved hundreds in repairs and there&#8217;s virtually no downside. I now put a tempered glass screen protector on every repair I do, and people love them.</p><p><strong>Flash Drive</strong> &#8211; It may not fit everybody&#8217;s needs, but if you got the 16GB phone (which winds up being more like 11GB), or use a lot of storage, it&#8217;s a must. I use mine daily to be able to keep files off my phone, and it makes transferring data that much easier as I don&#8217;t need to have a lightning cable to move data at work.</p><p><strong>Battery Pack</strong> &#8211; These things have saved my ass more than a few times. I have a 24000MAh battery pack, and it will charge my phone dead to full about six times. These are especially necessary if you&#8217;re one of the unlucky 6S owners whose phone dies at 35% after the 10.1 update. Regardless, though, I never leave home without mine.</p><h3><img class="size-full wp-image-1237 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/James-Goodnow.jpg" alt="James Goodnow" width="250" height="250" srcset="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/James-Goodnow.jpg 250w, http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/James-Goodnow-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"/>James Goodnow &#8211; <a href="https://lambergoodnow.com/tech/james-goodnow/" name="jamess">LamberGoodNow</a></h3><p><strong>A case</strong> &#8211; Protect your phone. iPhones are at least $500, so spend $10 and get a good case.</p><p><strong>Apple AirPods</strong> &#8211; Truly wireless earbuds.

The future is wireless, so embrace it now.</p><p><strong>A car charger</strong> &#8211; Keep a good one handy in your car to get a little extra juice on the ride in or home from work.</p><p>Nothing is more frustrating than needing to charge your phone and having to wait until you get home.

So to help you decide which accessories are worth purchasing and which are worth avoiding, here are my top 3 favorite iPhone accessories on the market today.</p><p><strong>Belkin Lightning Audio + Charge RockStar</strong> &#8211; If you’ve got an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, you’ll understand the hardship of not having a headphone jack anymore. This simple but crucial adapter enables the latest iPhone users to charge their device while listening to headphones without having to purchase Apple’s wireless AirPods.</p><p><strong>Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector</strong> &#8211; People hate using screen protectors because they make their smartphone&#8217;s display feel cheap and ugly. That being said, I’ve been using this particular tempered glass screen protector on my iPhone 6 Plus since buying the phone in 2014, and it’s as good as new.</p><p>Because of the glass texture and clarity of the screen protector, I forget I’m even using this accessory! If you want your device to look good and avoid scratches, this product is a must.</p><p><strong>Bose QuietComfort 35 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones</strong> &#8211; If you have an iPhone 7, you’re going to want a pair of decent wireless headphones, right? These are quite simply the pinnacle of noise canceling headphones.</p><p>Their sleek design, luxury comfort ear cups, long battery life and outstanding sound quality all join to create a near perfect accessory. They come at a price, but doesn’t everything that’s best in class?</p><h3><img class="size-full wp-image-1196 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Cassidy-Williams.jpg" alt="Cassidy Williams" width="250" height="250" srcset="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Cassidy-Williams.jpg 250w, http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Cassidy-Williams-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"/>Cassidy Williams &#8211; <a href="http://cassidoo.co/" name="cassidy">Cassidoo.co</a></h3><p><strong>My OtterBox case</strong> is my #1 go-to for cases.

This is why, most people don&#8217;t mind preferring a low-end Android phone, for the convenience it offers. One of the biggest problems that iPhone users go through is the low storage issue.</p><p>Until you have the 128GB variant, you will require a big chunk storage to keep your data that include songs, videos, and photos. However, at such circumstances, one simple, small and portable Flash Drive can be your best recourse.</p><p>If you are in need of Flash Drive, we would greatly recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CIEBU22/?tag=10beasts05c-20" rel="nofollow">Sandisk SanDisk USB 3.0 Flash Drive</a> without thinking twice. This flash drive takes care of all your videos and photos, and you can use it &#8211; anytime, anywhere.</p><p>Music is a dope for some, and the ultimate savior for some. Almost everyone has a strong feeling for good music and loves to listen to wonderful melodies. However, most of the times, he/she feels that the conventional long wires for music are way too messy.</p><p>Therefore, wireless music is the best way to enjoy music hassle-free. Trust <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013HSW4SM/?tag=10beasts05c-20" rel="nofollow">Jaybird X2</a> headphones for an incredible wireless experience.</p><p>The charging cable, with most of the Apple devices, is a sore aspect. Most of the times, they get easily damaged and aren&#8217;t long enough to reach your bed. Here are <a href="http://www.nativeunion.com/products/cables/?17">some cables</a> made by the Native Union, which are highly durable and long enough to stay in reach.</p><h3><img class="size-full wp-image-1225 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Ashish-Patel.jpg" alt="Ashish Patel" width="250" height="250" srcset="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Ashish-Patel.jpg 250w, http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Ashish-Patel-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"/>Ashish Patel &#8211; <a href="http://androidjungles.com/" name="ashish">AndroidJungles</a></h3><p>There are seemingly endless choices for iPhone accessories out there, and I’ve got to tell you, I go through iPhone accessories like candy. One day I like something I’m using, and another day I find it to be a nuisance, and I end up leaving it at home and buying something completely different to suit my needs.</p><p>Regardless, there are still some accessories that I still use on a day-to-day basis, and in this piece, I’ll show you my top 5 favorite iPhone accessories that I use on a daily basis and why.</p><p>Before getting started, one thing I’d like to note before I start is that these are my five favorite iPhone accessories that I use on a daily basis. I’m not trying to push them on anyone because I know everyone’s opinion is going to vary and not everyone is going to agree with my choices.</p><p>On the other hand, I do hope that in posting this it’ll help some people with accessory discovery. My daily driver is an iPhone 6 Plus, which is the previous-generation 5.5-inch iPhone.</p><p>Some of these accessories are also compatible with other iPhones out of the box, but some of them are available in different versions that are made specifically for all the different shapes and sizes of iPhones on the market today.</p><p>Having said that, let’s get into it, shall we?</p><div class="su-tabs su-tabs-style-default my-custom-tabs" data-active="1"><div class="su-tabs-nav"><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Otterbox Alpha Glass Privacy</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Speck Candyshell Grip</span><span class="" data-url="" data-target="blank">Plantronics M70 Bluetooth Headset</span></div><div class="su-tabs-panes"><div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix"><p>Probably one of my favorite and most-used accessories is the Alpha Glass Privacy screen protector from OtterBox.</p><p>It’s a tempered glass screen protector, which means it looks and feels like the factory glass screen on the iPhone. It doesn&#8217;t reduce the screen’s sensitivity capacities and also comes with the added benefit of blocking out the display at stark viewing angles. This way peering eyes around you can’t see what you’re doing on your iPhone – only you can.</p><p>The screen protector is also still a fully-functional, multi-layer screen protector that helps in keeping your main glass display from scratching and shattering.</p><p>It hugs the Home button and front-facing camera/speaker/sensors very well without being too tight and just feels like an overall good and natural fit.</p><p>One of the things I like about it is that it seems to work with almost every case I’ve ever tried with my iPhone, apart from the ones that come with built-in screen protectors.</p><p>This gives you the flexibility of changing cases every so often, and still keeping the benefits of the privacy glass whenever you want to.</p><p>A word of warning – although OtterBox doesn’t list this screen protector as compatible with the iPhone 6s Plus, I want to confirm with everyone, just as I have with OtterBox, that it will work just fine with the iPhone 6s Plus.</p><p>The reason it’s not listed as compatible is because it may interfere with the front-facing flash Apple coded into iOS 9, but 3D Touch and everything else works as expected.</p></div><div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix"><p>I’ve tried a lot of cases for my iPhone – believe me – and one of the best I’ve found so far in terms of not only protection but also how the case feels in my hand and how responsive the buttons are is the Speck Candyshell Grip.</p><p>I work on cars a lot, and this means getting dirty and using my iPhone’s rear-facing LED flash a lot to see things in dark places. I’ve tried lots of protective cases, and this one is just right regarding protection and size.</p><p>It’s not too thick, but it has a strong protective feel to it. I’ve dropped my iPhone in my engine compartment plenty of times, and you’d never know because the case has kept my iPhone protected each and every time.</p><p>The volume and power buttons have a very crisp ‘click’ through the protective rubber button boots on the sides of the case, which I can’t say for all cases that I’ve tried.</p><p>The responsiveness of the buttons feels almost like there’s no case on my iPhone at all, and the click you feel is still very much audible through the case.</p><p>One of the useful features of this case is the rubber grips that go all across the back of the case.</p><p>When you’re using your iPhone one-handed and always feel like you’re going to drop it while texting someone, especially the case with today’s larger iPhones, those grips help you keep the iPhone in your hand without worrying about having butter fingers.</p><p>The cut-outs for the ports are also big enough to fit all my third-party headphones, speakers, Lightning connectors, and other goodies, so I have no complaints in that department either. Engineering did a great job making this case and I’d recommend it to (almost) anyone.</p></div><div class="su-tabs-pane su-clearfix"><p>I do so much driving that it’s just not physically possible for me to constantly hold my iPhone up to my ear all day long. The Plantronics M70 Bluetooth headset has been my daily answer to that problem and it is a wonderful and affordable Bluetooth headset that works great with the iPhone.</p><p>The Plantronics M70 Bluetooth headset has been my daily solution to that problem, and it is a fantastic and affordable Bluetooth headset that works great with the iPhone.</p><p>Once being paired with the iPhone, the device’s battery level shows in the iPhone’s Status Bar, as well as in Notification Center under the Battery widget. The headset also supports invoking Siri by holding down on the button on the side for a couple of seconds, which I find super helpful throughout the day considering my iPhone’s internal microphones are dead because of water damage.</p><p>The headset also supports invoking Siri by holding down on the button on the side for a couple of seconds, which I find super helpful throughout the day considering my iPhone’s internal microphones are dead because of water damage.</p><p>This headset is easy to hear even in noisy environments, and the easy volume adjustments mean you can adjust for both noisy and quiet environments with ease. It also works great for listening to music; it’s not just for answering calls.

It’s charged with a Micro-USB type of cable that plugs into a USB port on your computer or an AC adapter for your outlet in your wall.</p><p>In terms of comfort, I think this is one of the more comfortable options out there, but just like anything else you wear on your ears, you may want to take it off after a while.

I know I can focus on my workout without having to worry about my iPhone bothering me or falling off.</p><p>3. The Anker Ultra Slim extended battery case.</p><p>If I’m traveling lightly, I don’t want extra bulk charging packs and cables, so the Anker battery case is ideal. It’s also great when my battery is running low, and I&#8217;m on the move, I just grab the case and know my iPhone will last another two days.</p><h3><strong><img class="size-full wp-image-1203 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Hemant-Mendiratta.jpg" alt="Hemant Mendiratta" width="250" height="250" srcset="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Hemant-Mendiratta.jpg 250w, http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Hemant-Mendiratta-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"/></strong>Hemant Mendiratta &#8211; <a href="https://www.techuntold.com/" name="hemant">TechUntold</a></h3><p><strong>Anker Battery Case</strong> &#8211; My favorite iPhone accessories are the ones that are seamless. Accessories where I have to carry a separate gadget become a hassle. The Anker Battery Case is a phone case that doubles as a charger. It protects your phone while adding that extra battery life you need.</p><p>A dead battery situation almost takes you 200 years back because we do everything on our phones, including that important Uber ride at 1 AM in the morning and communicating through Whatsapp or Facebook Messenger to your friends.</p><p>The Anker Case packs a 2850 mAh battery that they promise gives you an extra 60 hours of Audio, 13 hours of Video and 12 Hours of Browsing. You also get an audio jack extender with this case.</p><p>It’s a must have for people who are worried about losing battery at any point in time.</p><p><strong>Top Case for the iPhone</strong> &#8211; One of the situations that I fear is when I have to work when I’m traveling. I can check emails and look at updates, but my actual work involves writing content and replying to emails I don’t want to carry an iPad and for me, the best situation is getting a case like the TOP case, which has a QWERTY keyboard that comes part of the case. I can use With this case you can work continuously for 30 hours. If you are on holiday and exploring and don’t want to carry an iPad or a laptop with you, carry the TOP case.</p><p><strong>Mountie</strong> &#8211; It is an excellent gadget that lets you hook your iPhone to your laptop with a simple gadget. You can use the Mountie to keep your iPhone right next to the monitor.</p><p>This is useful for checking notifications on your phone and copying some important information. Developers can also use it as a multi-screen by having a laptop and a tablet right next to each other. The only downside to Mountie is that it does not work with desktops!</p><h3><strong><img class="size-full wp-image-1212 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Rebecca-Day.jpg" alt="Rebecca Day" width="243" height="243" srcset="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Rebecca-Day.jpg 243w, http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Rebecca-Day-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px"/></strong>Rebecca Day &#8211; <a href="https://www.geturgently.com/" rel="nofollow" name="rebecca">Urgent.ly</a></h3><p><strong>Protecting Case</strong> &#8211; My number 1 iPhone accessory will always be a good case. I&#8217;m currently using a LifeProof on my 6S. A few things I love about it:</p><ul><li>The way it keeps the iPhone from getting scratched and cracked.</li><li>Part of this is in the presence of casing itself.</li><li>LifeProof changes the weight and feel of the phone in a way that is somehow, magically, able to decrease the likelihood that I drop it.</li></ul><p>Waterproofing &#8211; I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;ve never tried submersion but I love that I can use my phone in the shower for listening to music, texting, and checking my email. I also appreciate that it&#8217;s protected when I drop it in puddles&#8230; I will say, though, that the LifeProof is far from my perfect case. The screen over the camera decreases the photo quality such that I may as well be using my first flip phone. It also makes it very difficult for people to hear me on phone calls, and vice versa.</p><p>This alone pretty much negates about half the usefulness of the case, as I&#8217;m constantly peeling it off to either take a photo or make a call. (Maybe someone else will recommend a better case for your article!)</p><p>Regardless, with how expensive iPhones are, my top pick for an accessory is something to protect my investment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><img class="size-full wp-image-1214 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Soham-Banker.jpg" alt="Soham Banker" width="250" height="250" srcset="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Soham-Banker.jpg 250w, http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Soham-Banker-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"/>Soham Banker &#8211; <a href="http://www.appsprison.com/" name="soham">AppsPrison.com</a></h3><p><strong>Wireless Charger Kit</strong> &#8211; This is a very portable accessory which I use in my day to day life.

Unlike most other iPhone battery cases, it is built much tougher, not easy to be broken and works with Lightning cables.</p><p>The one-piece design feels really comfortable and is sleek. With the case fully charged and my iPhone inside, I’m still at 100% by late afternoon. By 11 p.m, the case’s battery was expended but the iPhone still have about 65% percent charge left.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.kenu.com/products/stance">Kenu Stance Tripod</a></strong> &#8211; This tripod is one of my favorite gadgets. It is specifically designed for the iPhone as it mounts directly into the Lightning port. The reason I love this tripod is that it is tiny, light and secure for taking anywhere. It’s a great accessory to have around for watching videos, making video calls or positioning the device’s camera to shoot amazing photos.</p><h3><img class="size-full wp-image-1272 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Happy-Raj.jpg" alt="Happy Raj" width="251" height="251" srcset="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Happy-Raj.jpg 251w, http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Happy-Raj-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px"/>Happy Raj &#8211; <a href="http://www.bloomtimes.com/" name="happy">BloomTimes</a></h3><p>The best accessories iPhone can support are falsely assumed to be expensive. The truth is that the best accessories rarely require you to whip out more than $50.</p><p>The first accessory I recommend is Belkin Lightning Audio and Charger RockStar. I haven’t understood why they did away with the audio jack on the iPhone 7. It’s only a matter of time before we misplace our wireless headphones, so the cable is really an investment; because it lets you charge your phone as well as listen to music at the same time through the same port. It costs a mere 40 bucks too!</p><p>Then, there’s the iHome Mini Speaker Cube which comes for all of 17 dollars and still delivers quite a performance. In fact, it can be used for any device with a 3.5mm jack, and also supports FM Radio</p><p>But the biggest issue with phones today is that we can’t get enough of them. So a longer cord is pretty essential as well. I find EnacFire Lighting cable pack of 3 ft, six ft and ten ft especially useful. It’s great because you can choose to keep a special cord for your desk in the office and save the longer one for the bedroom to snuggle and binge watch movies on a Sunday.</p><h3><strong><img class="size-full wp-image-1215 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Shashank-Agrawal.jpg" alt="Shashank Agrawal" width="250" height="250" srcset="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Shashank-Agrawal.jpg 250w, http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Shashank-Agrawal-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"/></strong>Shashank Agrawal &#8211; <a href="http://appsjail.com/" name="shashank">AppsJail</a></h3><p>I’ve been a proud iPhone user for more than a year now. During the little experience that I have had while using iPhone, there were quite a few accessories that made my life easier.</p><p>I would like to place the <strong>iPhone charging dock station</strong> first on the list. I love the sight of my iPhone standing straight while getting charged, without hanging on to any wires. It complements my room as well.</p><p>Next up, is the <strong>iPhone car holder</strong>. It’s a tad bit difficult task to pick up a call, play music or even access the iPhone while driving unless you have a flexible iPhone car holder.</p><p>Along with it, Siri helps a lot to take things hands-free and make the driving hassle free.</p><p>The last one is a sleek and simple <strong>iPhone case</strong>. I get paranoid if I find a visible dirt on my iPhone. Now, I stay miles away from all the graphical iPhone cases.</p><p>I prefer a soft, durable and transparent iPhone case. It holds the slim look of my iPhone and provides the required protection at the same time.</p><p>My personal favorite among them is the iPhone car holder. I really enjoy my time in the car and it&#8217;s all because of the convenience being provided by the iPhone car holder.</p><h3><strong><img class="size-full wp-image-1204 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Chris-Schneider.jpg" alt="Chris Schneider" width="250" height="225"/></strong>Chris Schneider &#8211; <a href="http://awesome-drones.com/" name="chris">Awesome-Drones.com</a></h3><p>iPhone’s are extremely popular these days, despite the stiff competition from other phone manufacturers apple is still going strong and alone in 2016 they sold 1 billion units, yeah I know that&#8217;s crazy.</p><p>Even after Steve Job’s passing people camp 24 hours outside apple stores whenever there is a new iPhone launch just so they can get their hands on the latest models proves just how devoted this fan base really is.</p><p>With the growing popularity of these phones, it&#8217;s no wonder that many the accessories market has exploded with an endless choice, from cases of any color of the rainbow, to selfie sticks, Case wallets and you name it.</p><p>I know it can be confusing to decide what accessories you really need for your iPhone, so iv compiled a mini list of the top 3 accessories I think to cover a whole range of activities, so without further hesitation let&#8217;s jump straight to them.</p><p><strong>Mad Catz Micro C.T.R.L.i Mobile Gamepad</strong> &#8211; This little gadget turns your iPhone into a portable gaming console, think Nintendo DS but way more fun and useful. It connects seamlessly with your phone via Bluetooth and has an adjustable clip, so your iPhone can fit snug into it. It comes with an official apple certification, which means you will have no problems make good use of it. With the AAA batteries you can expect around 35 40 hours game time from the controller alone, this is good for people that tend to travel or commute a lot the ideal scenario would be on the bus, train or plane.</p><p><strong>XENVO Premium Camera Lens Kit</strong> &#8211; Smartphone photography, who doesn&#8217;t do it, these days you don&#8217;t need an expensive and heavy DSLR camera to take great pictures, you just need a relatively new smartphone and perhaps if you want to turn things up a notch you can even use the Xenvo lens kit on your iPhone for better results.</p><p>Basically it’s a mini wide angle that attaches to your iPhone&#8217;s front or back facing camera and it gives you 45% more picture without losing out on any quality, also if you like to take close of pictures of food or flowers then you can do that too with the Macro lens feature, so now you can start shooting fancy pictures for you Instagram account.</p><p><strong>Multifunctional iPhone Case</strong> &#8211; Or like how I like to call this case (Party Survival Case) this protective housing for your iPhone has definitely covered you at any party you go, let’s agree that smartphones have already a ton of functionality as is, like planners, music players, communication, games and so on, with this case it adds a layer of physical capabilities like beer opener, cigarette lighter and you can also attach it on your bicycle&#8217;s steering handles, so you would agree if I say that Chuck Norris would be proud of this case.</p><h3><strong><img class="wp-image-1232 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Joe-Cole.jpg" alt="Joe Cole" width="207" height="207" srcset="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Joe-Cole.jpg 190w, http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Joe-Cole-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 207px) 100vw, 207px"/></strong>Joe Cole &#8211; <a href="http://coupongoo.com/" name="joe">Coupongoo.com</a></h3><p>Apple is a universal brand and people love it. You can make your Apple iPhone even more interesting if you use different accessories, because a mobile is not everything in itself, for instance, you need a cable or charger to charge the mobile. In a similar manner, there are other accessories of Apple which you will find much more interesting and here are three that I think are the best</p><p><strong>Travel USB Cables:</strong> ordinary iPhone cables work perfectly well, but when it comes to the matter of traveling, space matters and for this reason, you must switch to shorter and highly-reliable travel cables that you can easily put in your pocket.</p><p><strong>External Battery:</strong> the first thing that many people consider when buying any mobile is the battery timing. Apple users always find it exhausting and frustrating to charge their mobile again and again. It is really a trouble when you are traveling and your mobile battery is dead. You can buy an external battery that will charge the mobile: it’s a great accessory.</p><p><strong>Laptop Backpack:</strong> If you have a Mac or an iPad then you certainly need a proper backpack to carry the Mac, iPad and their accessories. It is really difficult to carry these things without a proper bag, therefore you should buy one.</p><h3><strong><img class="size-full wp-image-1205 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Ankit-Raghav.jpg" alt="Ankit Raghav" width="250" height="250" srcset="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Ankit-Raghav.jpg 250w, http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Ankit-Raghav-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"/></strong>Ankit Raghav &#8211; <a href="http://gadgetlio.com/category/apple/" name="ankit">Gadgetlio.com</a></h3><p><strong>Kenu Stance Tripod</strong> &#8211; According to me, it is one of the best accessories for iPhone, Kenu Stance Tripod, especially available for iPhone, it will be best for those who wanna be some out of their device, and want to watch videos, without holding their iPhone in their hands.</p><p><strong>TuneBand Sports Armband</strong> &#8211; TuneBand Sports Armband, is a perfect case for those who are addicted to sports activities and own an iPhone, if you are a sportsman, and running is in your daily schedule, then it is best for you, it is perfect case and cover for your iPhone, with this you have no need to hold your device, it will tie your iPhone to your arm tightly and, your device will be safely staying with you.</p><p><strong>Belkin Lightning Audio + Charge Rockstar</strong> &#8211; If you have an iPhone 7, and missing 3.5 mm jack, then this is the simple Lightning port splitter, that can turn your single port into two, it means with this you can listen to music with ear plugs and charge your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus at the same time.</p><h3><strong><img class="size-full wp-image-1207 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Devendra-Meena.jpg" alt="Devendra Meena" width="250" height="250" srcset="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Devendra-Meena.jpg 250w, http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Devendra-Meena-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"/></strong>Devendra Meena &#8211; <a href="http://www.quickfever.com/" name="devendra">QuickFever.com</a></h3><p>The first thing came to my mind is the <strong>Apple&#8217;s Lightning dock</strong>, it makes those 3.5 MM jack headphones useful again.

In fact, the more accessories you have the less productive the phone becomes. I look for accessories that highlight the phone and not take away from it.</p><p><strong>A dash holder. I</strong> like sleek phones so cases bother me. So a simple magnet on the back does the trick.</p><p><strong>Wireless headphones</strong> with a good mic. I do business often on the road. Quality headphones play a large role in that.</p><p><strong>AppleTV</strong> is more than an accessory but it&#8217;s a perfect tool to take your iPhone to the next level.

We know from years of feedback from readers, staff, and even family and friends that most people want a case that’s slim, plainly designed, reliably protective, and inexpensive. That’s exactly what you get with the Base Grip.</p><p><strong>2. Tagrus Cable</strong>. It has one of the finest material, it works as good as the original. Technically, it gives 2A output as this much required which is quite efficient for your iPhone.</p><p><strong>3. Powerbank Mi 20000mAh.</strong> It has the fast charging 2A support with 1.5A support. If you want a good power bank then this is the best choice for your iPhone.</p><h3><img class="size-full wp-image-1222 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Shrivant-Saxena.jpg" alt="Shrivant Saxena" width="250" height="250" srcset="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Shrivant-Saxena.jpg 250w, http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Shrivant-Saxena-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"/>Shrivant Saxena &#8211; <a href="http://geekdiscover.com/" name="shrivant">GeekDiscover</a></h3><p>I&#8217;m more interested in the accessories which are of great use in day-to-day usage:</p><p><strong>SanDisk Connect Wireless Stick 64 GB Pen Drive </strong>&#8211; If you are someone who travels a lot and likes to watch movies or videos on your iPhone then this one is must for you. This wireless Stick doesn&#8217;t cost that much and allows you to access data on your iPhone or even on your Android on-the-air anywhere without even requiring an Internet connection.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth Speaker</strong> &#8211; For a music lover surviving without Headphones or a Bluetooth speaker is difficult. If you are not willing to spend much on Bluetooth Speakers then you can go with budget oriented Bluetooth Speakers like JBL Flip 3, JBL Charge 2(Recommended), Sony XRS XB3 which costs less than $150. I&#8217;ve been using JBL Charge 2 for 5 months and it&#8217;s definitely worth the price.</p><p><strong>Power Bank</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s always good to have some power backup in case your iPhone&#8217;s battery runs out. Invest in power banks which are easily available and not very expensive.</p><p>Personally, I would recommend Xiaomi Mi 20000 mAh Power Bank. For iPhone 7 users, make sure you have a good quality USB Type-C cable for your power bank.</p><h3><strong><img class="size-full wp-image-1221 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Shivam-Goel.jpg" alt="Shivam Goel" width="250" height="250" srcset="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Shivam-Goel.jpg 250w, http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Shivam-Goel-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"/></strong>Shivam Goel &#8211; <a href="http://nerdsdesk.com/" name="shivam">NerdsDesk</a></h3><p><strong>Spigen Liquid Crystal Case</strong> &#8211; You may ask what is special in this case which makes it different from the rest?

Apart from this, the case feels premium and robust in hands.</p><p>There will be times when the iPhone will slip from your hands, and this protective case will save you from burning a big hole in your pocket. So if you are buying iPhone then definitely make sure to buy this along else you may regret your decision later.</p><p><strong>Apple Smart Battery Case </strong>&#8211; Let get this straight. Apple has to improve the iPhone&#8217;s Battery life because iPhones are inferior in battery backup and it will be very hard to get to the end of the day with just one charge.</p><p>So if you are the one who doesn&#8217;t like to sit near the power outlet and use your iPhone while it&#8217;s connected to the charger, then this is for you.</p><p>It surely is priced a bit on higher side, but that&#8217;s what makes Apple different from rest of the mobile phone manufacturers.</p><p><strong>Desk Charger and Sync Dock Stand</strong> &#8211; This Desk Charger is also a good choice to buy as if you are working in a corporate it will save you from the hectic of connecting your iPhone again and again to your desk computer. It is directly attached to the computer via USB port, and you can just connect your iPhone to the dock stand. Apart from all this it also charges your smartphone side by side.</p><h3><strong><img class="wp-image-1235 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sacha-Ferrandi.jpg" alt="Sacha Ferrandi" width="216" height="233"/></strong>Sacha Ferrandi &#8211; <a href="https://www.hardmoneyfirst.com/" name="sacha">SourceCapitalFunding</a></h3><p><strong>Car Mounts </strong>&#8211; Smart and safe driving is important for all cell phone users. There are several great mounts on the market that easily clip onto the air conditioning vents of the car and enable a smooth and quick connection process. These mounts also limit texting and driving because it is more difficult to send off that &#8220;quick&#8221; text when the phone is mounted to your dashboard.</p><p><strong>Wallet Cases</strong> &#8211; We love a good wallet case. There are several cheap protective cases that have spaces for credit cards and a few dollars in cash. These cases not only free up space in a purse or bag, they also help keep everything in one place to reduce the risk of losing money or credit cards. We have found that most iPhone users look after the phone with much more diligence than their wallet and if both are in the same place, it is more difficult to lose them!</p><p><strong>Portable Chargers</strong> &#8211; Especially for business owners and people on the go for most of the day, having a portable charger is a must-have accessory. For many people, their phones are the key source of their business and a period of no battery could result in the loss of income. There are several small portable chargers out there that are easy to store and do not take up too much space.</p><h3><img class="size-full wp-image-1249 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dragoș-Nae.jpg" alt="Dragoș Nae" width="250" height="250" srcset="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dragoș-Nae.jpg 250w, http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dragoș-Nae-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"/>Dragoș Nae &#8211; <a href="http://www.ironsheep.tech/" name="dragos">IronSheepTECH</a></h3><p>In my opinion, the top three basic iPhone accessories that every power user should have are <strong>the headphones</strong>, as they sit comfortably in my ears.

It works with IOS 7 &amp; above and works with Bluetooth connection. It comes with AAA batteries and has 40 hours of GamePlay.</p><p>A <strong>selfie stick</strong> is a must have accessory for selfie lovers. When it comes to camera nothing can beat iPhone. Adding a Bluetooth selfie stick which can extend to 31 inches with 270-degree rotation will be an enhancement to it.</p><p>Thought the selfie stick can be replaced by a JBL Bluetooth speaker or a Beat&#8217;s on the ear headset, but again it depends on individual passion on it.</p><h3><strong><img class="size-full wp-image-1238 alignright" src="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Jerry-Lee.jpg" alt="Jerry Lee" width="250" height="250" srcset="http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Jerry-Lee.jpg 250w, http://www.10beasts.cn/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Jerry-Lee-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"/></strong>Jerry Lee &#8211; <a href="http://storyleather.com/" name="jerry">StoryLeather</a></h3><p><strong>Lifeproof Cases</strong> &#8211; These cases are great and very very popular amongst our users, simply for the fact that they are waterproofing the phone, and also impact resistant to prevent accidental drops.</p><p><strong>Mophie Juice Packs</strong> &#8211; With longer consumption of the iPhone, there&#8217;s never enough power for it to last throughout an entire day.

Belkin Lightning Audio + Charge Rockstar</strong></p><p>I recommend this to iPhone users because you can use your device for charging and can listen music at the same time. Simply, it&#8217;s a lightning port splitter.</p><p><strong>2. HooToo Flash Drive</strong></p><p>Storage for 16GB or 32GB variants is a big issue. This handy, compact flash drive can potentially help out. It has a Lightning connector at one end and a USB 3.0 port at the other. In the middle, there’s 64GB of storage for you to fill with photos, movies, or other files. It’s easy to slip into a pocket or bag, it transfers files quickly via a handy app, and it offers an alternative backup method that doesn’t require a cable. It is also MFi-certified.</p><p><strong>3. Mujjo Touchscreen Gloves</strong></p><p>It&#8217;s not easy to use your phone in winters, you can&#8217;t use your device with gloves but they allow you to touch your phone with warm gloves.. For colder climes, we recommend the double-layered gloves, available in three sizes with a magnetic clasp for a snug fit. They’re really comfortable, warm, and stylish at the same time. Mujjo does also offer basic varieties for a bit less, or you can splash out on a leather pair.</p><h3>So, that was ALL!</h3><p>HUGE thanks to everyone who contributed to this roundup!

Knowing the after-effects (i.e. touchscreen unresponsiveness and random rebooting) of the damage caused by nasty bumps, it hugely pays to be on the safer side of the stream.</p><p>Bluetooth headphone is what you need to keep you cheered up all the time with aplomb. Whether you are hitting it out in the gym or walking in the garden, going on a long drive or working in your office, you need those earbuds to help you remain at the top of your game with the desired comfort.</p><p>As for battery case, I would say it’s a must to have some additional power to watch your favorite videos, browse web with the needed peace of mind and remain free from the headache of juicing up your iPhone too often.</p></div><div class="comment-reply"><a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='http://www.10beasts.cn/best-iphone-accessories/?replytocom=2443#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-2443", "2443", "respond", "1182" )' aria-label='Reply to Dhvanesh'>Reply</a></div> </article></li><li class="comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-2796"> <article itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"> <header class="comment-header"><p class="comment-author" itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <img alt='' src='http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5d488a0dfdf71ad011e9b1dce2e4d83b?s=48&#038;r=g' srcset='http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5d488a0dfdf71ad011e9b1dce2e4d83b?s=96&amp;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-48 photo' height='48' width='48'/><span itemprop="name"><a href="http://gauravheera.com" class="comment-author-link" rel="external nofollow" itemprop="url">Gaurav heera</a></span> <span class="says">says</span></p><p class="comment-meta"><time class="comment-time" datetime="2017-04-14T12:22:02+00:00" itemprop="datePublished"><a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/best-iphone-accessories/#comment-2796" class="comment-time-link" itemprop="url">April 14, 2017 at 12:22 pm</a></time></p> </header><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><p>hello,<br/> you all are great and you all are share your views with us it&#8217;s really great and motivational for us I really like your thought like how to post your blogs it&#8217;s really inspirable for me.</p></div><div class="comment-reply"><a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='http://www.10beasts.cn/best-iphone-accessories/?replytocom=2796#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-2796", "2796", "respond", "1182" )' aria-label='Reply to Gaurav heera'>Reply</a></div> </article></li><li class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1" id="comment-2861"> <article itemprop="comment" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"> <header class="comment-header"><p class="comment-author" itemprop="author" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <img alt='' src='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fea453949a0115cf31d724297cd665bd?s=48&#038;r=g' srcset='http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fea453949a0115cf31d724297cd665bd?s=96&amp;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-48 photo' height='48' width='48'/><span itemprop="name">Shoaib</span> <span class="says">says</span></p><p class="comment-meta"><time class="comment-time" datetime="2017-04-20T09:55:06+00:00" itemprop="datePublished"><a href="http://www.10beasts.cn/best-iphone-accessories/#comment-2861" class="comment-time-link" itemprop="url">April 20, 2017 at 9:55 am</a></time></p> </header><div class="comment-content" itemprop="text"><p>Nice info.
